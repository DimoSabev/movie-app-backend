2
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:39,837
Are you paying attention?

3
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,435
Good.

4
00:01:44,612 --> 00:01:46,944
If you're not listening carefully,

5
00:01:47,115 --> 00:01:49,880
you will miss things,

6
00:01:50,051 --> 00:01:52,110
important things.

7
00:01:52,287 --> 00:01:53,755
I will not pause.

8
00:01:53,922 --> 00:01:55,253
I will not repeat myself,

9
00:01:55,423 --> 00:01:58,017
and you will not interrupt me.

10
00:02:00,028 --> 00:02:03,259
You think that because you are sitting where you are

11
00:02:03,431 --> 00:02:05,024
and I am sitting where I am

12
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,067
that you are in control of what is about to happen.

13
00:02:08,236 --> 00:02:10,705
You're mistaken.

14
00:02:10,872 --> 00:02:12,806
I am in control.

15
00:02:12,974 --> 00:02:16,137
Because I know things that you

16
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:18,473
do not know.

17
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:24,146
Manchester Police Department,please hold.

18
00:02:26,321 --> 00:02:27,618
Windows broken.

19
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:29,154
Home's been ransacked.

20
00:02:29,324 --> 00:02:31,315
Send a detective down, will you?

21
00:02:31,493 --> 00:02:33,552
What I will need from you now

22
00:02:33,728 --> 00:02:36,060
is a commitment.

23
00:02:36,231 --> 00:02:38,996
You will listen closely,and you will not

24
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:41,397
judge me until I am finished.

25
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:43,333
If you cannot commit to this,

26
00:02:43,505 --> 00:02:45,064
then please leave the room.

27
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,469
Come in.

28
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:47,836
But if you choose to stay,

29
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:49,977
remember you chose to be here.

30
00:02:50,145 --> 00:02:51,772
What happens

31
00:02:51,946 --> 00:02:55,075
from this moment forwards is not my responsibility.

32
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,615
It's yours.

33
00:02:59,854 --> 00:03:02,824
Pay attention.

34
00:03:15,031 --> 00:03:16,499
What's all this, then?

35
00:03:16,137 --> 00:03:17,764
Turing, Alan.

36
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:19,964
Professor at King's.

37
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:21,472
Seems there's been a burglary.

38
00:03:21,643 --> 00:03:23,111
Oh? What of?

39
00:03:23,278 --> 00:03:25,007
Well, that's just it.Nothing missing, really.

40
00:03:26,514 --> 00:03:28,642
What's he doing in Manchester?

41
00:03:28,816 --> 00:03:31,808
Something with machines.

42
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,828
The project at the NPL.

43
00:03:40,995 --> 00:03:42,895
I checked, but he won't say what it's on.

44
00:03:44,465 --> 00:03:46,957
Professor Turing?

45
00:03:47,135 --> 00:03:49,001
Detective Nook,Manchester Police.

46
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,472
Sergeant Staehl here tells me you had a burglary last night.

47
00:03:56,644 --> 00:03:58,976
Professor Turing?

48
00:03:59,147 --> 00:04:00,911
Take a step back,

49
00:04:01,082 --> 00:04:02,982
and don't breath heavily.

50
00:04:03,151 --> 00:04:05,347
- Breathe?
-Undiluted cyanide.

51
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,851
It-it wouldn't take

52
00:04:07,021 --> 00:04:10,013
more than a thimbleful to kill you.

53
00:04:10,191 --> 00:04:12,159
Ah.

54
00:04:12,327 --> 00:04:13,726
Disappointing.

55
00:04:13,895 --> 00:04:15,192
Pardon?

56
00:04:15,363 --> 00:04:18,230
L-I had hoped for a bit more.

57
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,992
Sergeant Staehl, is it just me,or do you get the sense

58
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:21,158
that we're being insulted?

59
00:04:21,336 --> 00:04:23,270
Last night, you had a break-in.

60
00:04:23,438 --> 00:04:26,032
Your neighbor, Mr. Springborn,called to report the noise.

61
00:04:26,207 --> 00:04:28,039
He said there was quite a ruckus.

62
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:29,699
Only you say nothing was taken.

63
00:04:29,877 --> 00:04:31,845
It's odd.So how about you tell us

64
00:04:32,013 --> 00:04:33,777
what happened, and we'll find the chap who did this.

65
00:04:33,948 --> 00:04:35,245
Gentlemen,

66
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:36,850
I-I don't believe

67
00:04:37,018 --> 00:04:38,679
that you could find the chap that did this

68
00:04:38,853 --> 00:04:41,015
if, uh, he walked up to you and spat in your face.

69
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:42,918
Uh, what I could use right now

70
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:46,186
is not a bobby,but a really good cleaning lady.

71
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:48,193
So unless one of you has a-an apron

72
00:04:48,363 --> 00:04:49,694
in your car, I suggest

73
00:04:49,864 --> 00:04:52,595
you file your reports and leave me alone.

74
00:04:53,868 --> 00:04:56,701
As you say, Professor Turing.

75
00:04:59,941 --> 00:05:02,740
Best of luck with your cyanide.

76
00:05:03,566 --> 00:05:04,234
I'll give you a quid

77
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:06,492
if you can name me a more insufferable sod.

78
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:08,040
Seemed a bit forced,though, didn't it?

79
00:05:08,216 --> 00:05:09,547
Don't know what you mean.

80
00:05:09,717 --> 00:05:11,276
Well, if you didn't want a pair of bobbies

81
00:05:11,452 --> 00:05:13,147
digging around in your personal affairs,

82
00:05:13,321 --> 00:05:16,154
that'd have been a stellar way to make sure they don't.

83
00:05:16,324 --> 00:05:18,315
Tell me you don't think this is suspicious.

84
00:05:18,493 --> 00:05:19,756
I don't think this is suspicious.

85
00:05:19,927 --> 00:05:21,918
A mysterious professor who won't admit

86
00:05:22,096 --> 00:05:23,894
he's had something stolen from his house?

87
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:26,430
I think Alan Turing's

88
00:05:26,601 --> 00:05:28,569
hiding something.

89
00:05:38,813 --> 00:05:39,803
War declared!

90
00:05:39,981 --> 00:05:41,949
800,000 children evacuated!

91
00:05:42,116 --> 00:05:43,811
German bombs on their way!

92
00:05:43,985 --> 00:05:45,077
Get your papers here!

93
00:05:45,253 --> 00:05:46,243
Fresh off the press!

94
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:47,411
War declared!

95
00:05:47,588 --> 00:05:49,750
800,000 children evacuated!

96
00:05:49,924 --> 00:05:51,949
German bombs expected soon!

97
00:06:17,952 --> 00:06:19,477
This morning,

98
00:06:19,654 --> 00:06:21,816
the British Ambassador in Berlin

99
00:06:21,989 --> 00:06:23,548
handed the German government

100
00:06:23,725 --> 00:06:26,387
a final note stating that

101
00:06:26,561 --> 00:06:28,620
unless we heard from them,

102
00:06:28,796 --> 00:06:30,230
by 11:00,

103
00:06:30,398 --> 00:06:32,127
a state of war

104
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,631
would exist between us.

105
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:36,801
I have to tell you now

106
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:39,497
that no such undertaking has been received.

107
00:06:39,674 --> 00:06:41,802
And that, consequently,

108
00:06:41,976 --> 00:06:44,138
this country is at war

109
00:06:44,312 --> 00:06:46,644
with Germany.

110
00:07:11,873 --> 00:07:13,671
For the second time

111
00:07:13,841 --> 00:07:16,333
in the lives of most of us,

112
00:07:16,511 --> 00:07:18,912
we are...

113
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,570
at war.

114
00:07:20,748 --> 00:07:23,445
...to find

115
00:07:23,618 --> 00:07:25,552
a peaceful way out...

116
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,724
Papers, please.

117
00:08:07,261 --> 00:08:08,786
What are you doing here?

118
00:08:08,963 --> 00:08:11,159
Oh, uh,the lady told me to wait.

119
00:08:11,332 --> 00:08:12,925
In my office?

120
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,966
She tell you to help yourself to tea

121
00:08:15,136 --> 00:08:16,160
while you were here?

122
00:08:16,337 --> 00:08:18,999
Uh, no, she didn't.

123
00:08:19,173 --> 00:08:20,436
She obviously didn't tell you

124
00:08:20,608 --> 00:08:21,905
what a joke was, then,either, I gather.

125
00:08:22,076 --> 00:08:23,976
Was she supposed to?

126
00:08:25,646 --> 00:08:27,114
Who are you?

127
00:08:27,281 --> 00:08:29,249
Alan Turing.

128
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:31,511
Ah, Turing.

129
00:08:31,686 --> 00:08:32,744
The mathematician.

130
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,710
Correct.

131
00:08:33,466 --> 00:08:35,829
- However could I have guessed?
-Well, you didn't.

132
00:08:36,023 --> 00:08:37,855
You just read it on that piece of paper.

133
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,453
King's College, Cambridge.

134
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:43,188
Now, it says here you were a bit of a prodigy

135
00:08:43,364 --> 00:08:44,627
in the maths department.

136
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,769
L-I'm not sure I can evaluate that, Mr...

137
00:08:47,935 --> 00:08:49,926
- How old are you, Mr. Turing?
-Uh, 27.

138
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,438
And how old were you when you became a Fellow at Cambridge?

139
00:08:52,607 --> 00:08:54,701
- 24.
-And how old were you

140
00:08:54,876 --> 00:08:56,366
when you published this paper that has a title

141
00:08:56,544 --> 00:08:57,636
I can barely understand?

142
00:08:57,812 --> 00:09:00,144
- Uh, 23.
-And you don't think

143
00:09:00,314 --> 00:09:02,612
that qualifies you as a certified prodigy?

144
00:09:02,783 --> 00:09:04,581
Well, Newton discovered binomial theorem aged 22.

145
00:09:04,785 --> 00:09:07,846
Einstein wrote four papers that changed the world

146
00:09:08,022 --> 00:09:09,183
by the age of 26.

147
00:09:09,357 --> 00:09:10,449
As far as I can tell,

148
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,752
I've...

149
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:13,484
I've barely made par.

150
00:09:13,661 --> 00:09:14,958
My God, you're serious.

151
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:16,528
Would you prefer I made a joke?

152
00:09:16,697 --> 00:09:18,631
Oh, I don't think you know what those are.

153
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,289

154
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:21,629
for employment here, Mr...

155
00:09:21,802 --> 00:09:23,736
Commander Denniston,Royal Navy.

156
00:09:23,905 --> 00:09:25,373
All right,Mr. Turing, I'll bite.

157
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,702
Why do you wish to work for His Majesty's government?

158
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,707
Oh, I don't, really.

159
00:09:29,877 --> 00:09:32,676
Are you a bleeding pacifist?

160
00:09:32,847 --> 00:09:35,145
I'm... agnostic about violence.

161
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,512
Well, you do realize

162
00:09:36,684 --> 00:09:38,413
that 600 miles away from London

163
00:09:38,586 --> 00:09:40,520
there's this nasty little chap called Hitler

164
00:09:40,688 --> 00:09:42,747
who wants to engulf Europe in tyranny?

165
00:09:42,924 --> 00:09:44,688
Politics isn't really my area of expertise.

166
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:46,190
Really?

167
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,590
Well, I believe you've just set the record

168
00:09:48,763 --> 00:09:49,753
for the shortest job interview

169
00:09:49,931 --> 00:09:51,365
in British military history.

170
00:09:51,532 --> 00:09:52,931
Oh, uh...

171
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,034
Mother says I can be off-putting sometimes on account

172
00:09:55,202 --> 00:09:57,102
of being one of the best mathematicians in the world.

173
00:09:57,271 --> 00:09:58,932
In the world?

174
00:09:59,106 --> 00:10:00,699
Oh, yes.

175
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,207
Do you know how many people I've rejected for this program?

176
00:10:03,377 --> 00:10:05,505
- No.
-Well, that's right,

177
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,114
because we're a top-secret program.

178
00:10:07,281 --> 00:10:09,375
But I'll tell you,just because we're friends,

179
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,949
that only last week,

180
00:10:11,118 --> 00:10:13,951
I rejected one of our great nation's top linguists.

181
00:10:14,121 --> 00:10:16,317
Knows German better than Bertolt Brecht.

182
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,480
I don't speak German.

183
00:10:17,692 --> 00:10:19,251
What?

184
00:10:19,427 --> 00:10:21,020
I don't...

185
00:10:21,195 --> 00:10:22,560
speak German.

186
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,391
Well, how the hell were you supposed to decrypt

187
00:10:24,565 --> 00:10:26,055
German communications if you don't...

188
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:28,099
I don't know, speak German?

189
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:30,670
Well, I'm really quite excellent at crossword puzzles.

190
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:33,432
- Margaret!
-The German codes are a puzzle.

191
00:10:33,608 --> 00:10:35,269
A game, just like any other game.

192
00:10:35,443 --> 00:10:37,070
- Margaret, where are you?
-I'm really very good at games.

193
00:10:37,244 --> 00:10:38,712
Uh, puzzles.

194
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:41,280
And this is the most difficult puzzle in the world.

195
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:43,076
Margaret!

196
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,581
For the love of God.

197
00:10:44,752 --> 00:10:45,981
This is a joke, obviously.

198
00:10:46,153 --> 00:10:48,713
I'm afraid I don't know what those are,

199
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:50,755
Commander Denniston.

200
00:10:50,925 --> 00:10:53,360
Have a pleasant trip back to Cambridge, Professor.

201
00:10:53,561 --> 00:10:54,619
Enigma.

202
00:10:54,795 --> 00:10:56,729
You called for me?

203
00:11:04,271 --> 00:11:06,171
That's what you're doing here.

204
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,002
The top-secret program at Bletchley.

205
00:11:09,176 --> 00:11:12,339
You're trying to break the German Enigma machine.

206
00:11:12,513 --> 00:11:14,845
What makes you think that?

207
00:11:15,016 --> 00:11:17,348
It's the greatest encryption device in history,

208
00:11:17,518 --> 00:11:20,613
and the Germans use it for all major communications.

209
00:11:20,788 --> 00:11:23,314
If the Allies broke Enigma,

210
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:25,425
well

211
00:11:25,593 --> 00:11:27,322
This would turn into a very short war, indeed.

212
00:11:27,495 --> 00:11:30,328
Of course that's what you're working on.

213
00:11:30,498 --> 00:11:33,092
But you also haven't got anywhere with it.

214
00:11:33,267 --> 00:11:34,632
If you had, you wouldn't be hiring cryptographers

215
00:11:34,802 --> 00:11:36,634
out of university.

216
00:11:36,804 --> 00:11:38,795
Y- You need me a lot more than I need you.

217
00:11:38,973 --> 00:11:40,873
L-I like solving problems,

218
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:42,635
Commander.

219
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:46,542
And Enigma is the most difficult problem in the world.

220
00:11:46,714 --> 00:11:49,012
No, Enigma isn't difficult;it's impossible.

221
00:11:49,183 --> 00:11:51,481
The Americans, the Russians,the French,

222
00:11:51,652 --> 00:11:53,677
the Germans,everyone thinks Enigma

223
00:11:53,854 --> 00:11:54,912
is unbreakable.

224
00:11:55,122 --> 00:11:56,351
Good.

225
00:11:56,524 --> 00:11:58,890
Let me try,and we'll know for sure,

226
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,822
won't we?

227
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:03,620
Welcome to Enigma.

228
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,465
The details of every surprise attack,

229
00:12:08,636 --> 00:12:12,163
every secret convoy

230
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:14,501
and every U-boat in the bloody Atlantic

231
00:12:14,675 --> 00:12:16,404
go into that thing.

232
00:12:16,577 --> 00:12:19,808
And out comes gibberish.

233
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,540
It's beautiful.

234
00:12:22,717 --> 00:12:25,550
It's the crooked hand of death itself.

235
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,850
Our Wrens intercept thousands of radio messages a day,

236
00:12:30,024 --> 00:12:32,015
and to the lovely young ladies

237
00:12:32,193 --> 00:12:34,093
of the Women's Royal Navy,they're nonsense.

238
00:12:34,261 --> 00:12:37,196
It's only when you feed them back into Enigma

239
00:12:37,364 --> 00:12:38,960
that they make any sense.

240
00:12:39,105 --> 00:12:41,195
But we have an Enigma machine.

241
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:42,096
Yes, Polish Intelligence

242
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:43,361
smuggled it out of Berlin.

243
00:12:43,537 --> 00:12:44,527
So what's the problem?

244
00:12:44,705 --> 00:12:45,934
Just put the intercepted messages

245
00:12:46,107 --> 00:12:47,097
back into the Enigma and you'll...

246
00:12:47,274 --> 00:12:49,936
Look, it's not that simple, is it?

247
00:12:50,111 --> 00:12:52,273
Just having an Enigma machine

248
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:54,005
doesn't help you to decode the messages.

249
00:12:54,181 --> 00:12:57,014
Very good, Mr. Turing.

250
00:12:57,184 --> 00:12:59,846
To decode a message, you need to know the machine's settings.

251
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,512
Now, the Germans switch settings

252
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,818
every day promptly at midnight.

253
00:13:05,025 --> 00:13:06,220
We usually intercept

254
00:13:06,393 --> 00:13:08,191
our first message around 6:00 a.m.,

255
00:13:08,362 --> 00:13:09,955
which gives you exactly

256
00:13:10,131 --> 00:13:14,068
18 hours every day to crack the code

257
00:13:14,235 --> 00:13:16,431
before it changes,and you start again.

258
00:13:16,604 --> 00:13:17,969
Five rotors.

259
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:20,130
Ten plugboard cables.

260
00:13:20,307 --> 00:13:21,706
- One million...
-A thousand million...

261
00:13:21,876 --> 00:13:23,469
No, no, it's,uh, I've got it.

262
00:13:23,644 --> 00:13:25,942
It's million, million. It's in the millions, obviously.

263
00:13:26,113 --> 00:13:28,980
It's over 150 million million million possible settings.

264
00:13:29,181 --> 00:13:30,422
Very good.

265
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:31,277

266
159

267
00:13:33,154 --> 00:13:35,316
If you want to be exact about it. 1-5-9

268
00:13:35,489 --> 00:13:37,719
with 18 zeroes behind it.

269
00:13:37,892 --> 00:13:39,382
Possibilities.

270
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,289
Every single day.

271
00:13:41,462 --> 00:13:43,954
Gentlemen, meet Hugh Alexander.

272
00:13:44,131 --> 00:13:45,826
I personally selected him

273
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,264
- to run this unit.
-Didn't you...

274
00:13:48,435 --> 00:13:50,403
Mr. Alexander won Britain's national chess championship.

275
00:13:50,571 --> 00:13:51,970
Twice.

276
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:53,470
You're not the only one

277
00:13:53,641 --> 00:13:54,836
who's good at games around here, Turing.

278
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:57,501
Are-are we to work together, then?

279
00:13:57,678 --> 00:13:59,840
I prefer to have my own office.

280
00:14:00,014 --> 00:14:01,846
You're a team,and you will work as one.

281
00:14:02,016 --> 00:14:04,348
I-I-I don't have time to explain myself as I go along,

282
00:14:04,518 --> 00:14:06,111
and I'm afraid these men

283
00:14:06,287 --> 00:14:08,517
- would only slow me down.
-If you can't

284
00:14:08,689 --> 00:14:11,659
play together, then I'm afraid we can't let you play at all.

285
00:14:11,826 --> 00:14:13,521
This is Stewart Menzies, MI6.

286
00:14:13,694 --> 00:14:15,685
There are only five divisions of military intelligence.

287
00:14:15,863 --> 00:14:17,763
There is no MI6.

288
00:14:17,932 --> 00:14:19,297
Exactly.

289
00:14:19,466 --> 00:14:21,833
That's the spirit.

290
00:14:22,002 --> 00:14:23,800
Mr. Turing, do you know how many British servicemen

291
00:14:23,971 --> 00:14:24,961
have died because of Enigma?

292
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:27,039
Uh, no, I don't.

293
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,972
Three...

294
00:14:29,143 --> 00:14:30,133
while we've been having

295
00:14:30,311 --> 00:14:32,279
this conversation.

296
00:14:33,814 --> 00:14:36,044
Oh, look, there's another.

297
00:14:36,217 --> 00:14:38,345
I rather hope he didn't have a family.

298
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,819
This war Commander Denniston's been going on about,

299
00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:43,718
we're not winning it.

300
00:14:43,891 --> 00:14:45,518
Break the code,

301
00:14:45,693 --> 00:14:48,628
at least we have a chance.

302
00:14:48,796 --> 00:14:51,356
Shall we leave the children alone

303
00:14:51,532 --> 00:14:53,057
with their new toy?

304
00:14:53,234 --> 00:14:54,326
Hm.

305
00:14:57,872 --> 00:15:01,536
All right, gentlemen...

306
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:04,371
let's play.

307
00:15:07,882 --> 00:15:10,681
The game was quite a simple one.

308
00:15:13,721 --> 00:15:16,190
Every single German message,every surprise attack,

309
00:15:16,357 --> 00:15:17,984
every bombing run,

310
00:15:18,158 --> 00:15:20,684
every imminent U-boat assault...

311
00:15:26,867 --> 00:15:29,165
They were all floating through the air.

312
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:40,611
Radio signals that...

313
00:15:40,781 --> 00:15:43,716
well, any schoolboy with an AM kit

314
00:15:43,884 --> 00:15:45,443
could intercept.

315
00:15:47,588 --> 00:15:50,922
The trick was that they were encrypted.

316
00:16:01,435 --> 00:16:04,871
There were 159 million million million possible

317
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,803
Enigma settings.

318
00:16:06,974 --> 00:16:09,238
All we had to do was try each one.

319
00:16:12,913 --> 00:16:16,474
But if we had ten men checking one setting a minute

320
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:20,109
for 24 hours every day and seven days every week,

321
00:16:20,287 --> 00:16:24,815
how many days do you think it would take to, uh, to check

322
00:16:24,992 --> 00:16:27,393
each of the settings?

323
00:16:29,096 --> 00:16:32,327
Well, it's not days, it's years.

324
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:34,058
Good morning.

325
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:38,068
It's 2O million years.

326
00:16:38,238 --> 00:16:39,967
- To stop a coming attack,
-Thank you.

327
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,269
We would have to check 2O million years' worth

328
00:16:43,444 --> 00:16:45,173
of settings

329
00:16:45,346 --> 00:16:47,508
in 2O minutes.

330
00:17:13,974 --> 00:17:14,998
I'm famished.

331
00:17:15,175 --> 00:17:17,143
Lunch?

332
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,642
Good Lord. What is it

333
00:17:18,812 --> 00:17:20,678
about women with little hats?

334
00:17:27,621 --> 00:17:31,148
The boys, we're going to get some lunch.

335
00:17:34,128 --> 00:17:36,062
Alan?

336
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,664
Yes'?

337
00:17:37,831 --> 00:17:39,390
I said we're going to get some lunch.

338
00:17:42,136 --> 00:17:43,570
Alan?

339
00:17:43,737 --> 00:17:44,727
Yes'?

340
00:17:44,905 --> 00:17:46,339
- Can you hear me?
-Yes.

341
00:17:46,507 --> 00:17:49,670
I said we're off to get some lu...

342
00:17:49,843 --> 00:17:51,971
This is starting to get a little bit repetitive.

343
00:17:52,146 --> 00:17:53,511
- What is?
-I had asked

344
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,011
if you wanted to come to lunch with us.

345
00:17:55,182 --> 00:17:56,581
Um, no, you didn't.

346
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,844
You said you were going to get some lunch.

347
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:01,010
Have I offended you in some way?

348
00:18:01,188 --> 00:18:02,349
Why would you think that?

349
00:18:02,523 --> 00:18:05,015
Would you like to come to lunch with us?

350
00:18:05,192 --> 00:18:06,921
- What time's lunchtime?
-Christ, Alan,

351
00:18:07,094 --> 00:18:08,186
it's a bleeding sandwich.

352
00:18:08,362 --> 00:18:10,091
- What is?
-Lunch.

353
00:18:10,264 --> 00:18:12,028
Oh, I don't like sandwiches.

354
00:18:12,199 --> 00:18:13,394
Never mind.

355
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:15,228
You know,

356
00:18:15,402 --> 00:18:17,564
to pull off this irascible genius routine,

357
00:18:17,738 --> 00:18:19,331
one actually has to be a genius, Alan.

358
00:18:19,506 --> 00:18:20,837
And yet we're the ones

359
00:18:21,008 --> 00:18:22,066
making progress here,aren't we?

360
00:18:22,242 --> 00:18:23,403
Oh, you are?

361
00:18:23,577 --> 00:18:25,602
Yes, we are.

362
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:29,113
We have decrypted a number of German messages

363
00:18:29,283 --> 00:18:32,514
by analyzing the frequency of letter distribution.

364
00:18:32,686 --> 00:18:35,121
Oh, even a broken clock is right twice a day.

365
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:37,087
That-That's not progress;that's just blind luck.

366
00:18:37,257 --> 00:18:39,123
I'm designing a machine

367
00:18:39,293 --> 00:18:41,523
that will allow us to break every message

368
00:18:41,695 --> 00:18:45,529
every day instantly.

369
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,063
Who's hungry?

370
00:18:49,103 --> 00:18:50,229
Let's go.

371
00:18:50,404 --> 00:18:51,565
I'm hungry-

372
00:18:52,806 --> 00:18:54,274
What?

373
00:18:54,441 --> 00:18:56,409
Peter asked who was hungry.

374
00:18:56,577 --> 00:18:57,942
Can I have some soup, please?

375
00:20:24,998 --> 00:20:27,399
What do you mean, "classified"?

376
00:20:27,568 --> 00:20:30,401
No, I'm aware of the literal meaning of the word classified.

377
00:20:30,571 --> 00:20:32,562
What I'm asking is why would a maths professor

378
00:20:32,739 --> 00:20:35,174
have his military records classified?

379
00:20:36,877 --> 00:20:38,811
Yeah, well, I will come down.

380
00:20:59,233 --> 00:21:01,668
Pardon me, I'd like to see some documents, if I may.

381
00:21:01,835 --> 00:21:05,066
Service records of a Mr. Turing.

382
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:06,263
Alan.

383
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,772
Foreign Office sent me.

384
00:21:15,082 --> 00:21:17,414
This is unacceptable.

385
00:21:17,584 --> 00:21:19,450
If you wish to discuss the complaint,

386
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,746
I suggest you make a proper appointment.

387
00:21:20,921 --> 00:21:21,911
Alexan...

388
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:23,215
Complaint?

389
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,789
No, no, Hugh Alexander

390
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,393
has denied my requisition for parts

391
00:21:27,561 --> 00:21:29,586
and-and equipment that I need to build the machine I've designed.

392
00:21:29,763 --> 00:21:31,629
Your fellow code-breakers are refusing to work with you,

393
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:33,197
and they filed a formal complaint.

394
00:21:33,367 --> 00:21:34,892
It's is inspired by an old Polish code machine.

395
00:21:35,068 --> 00:21:37,799
Only this one is infinitely more advanced.

396
00:21:37,971 --> 00:21:39,268
If you don't respond to the complaint,

397
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:41,066
I shall have to take it up with the Home Office.

398
00:21:41,241 --> 00:21:42,606
Put those files by my desk.

399
00:21:42,776 --> 00:21:44,244
Fine, my response is they're all idiots.

400
00:21:44,411 --> 00:21:46,311
Fire them and use the savings to fund my machine.

401
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,245
I only need about 100,000 pounds.

402
00:21:50,484 --> 00:21:51,645
100,000...

403
00:21:53,253 --> 00:21:54,948
Why are you building a machine?

404
00:21:55,122 --> 00:21:58,251
It's highly technical.You wouldn't understand.

405
00:21:58,425 --> 00:22:01,122
I suggest you make the effort to try.

406
00:22:01,295 --> 00:22:04,230
Enigma is...

407
00:22:04,398 --> 00:22:06,127
an extremely well-designed machine.

408
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,099
Our problem is that we're only using men to try to beat it.

409
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:11,169
No, what if only a machine

410
00:22:11,338 --> 00:22:13,670
can defeat another machine?

411
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,308
Well, that's not very technical.

412
00:22:15,475 --> 00:22:16,840
Hugh Alexander is in charge

413
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,342
of your unit; he said no,and that is that.

414
00:22:19,513 --> 00:22:20,947
I simply don't have time for this.

415
00:22:21,114 --> 00:22:23,947
Have you ever won a war, Turing?

416
00:22:24,117 --> 00:22:25,983
I have.

417
00:22:26,153 --> 00:22:27,814
Do you know how it's done?

418
00:22:27,988 --> 00:22:29,149
Order, discipline,

419
00:22:29,323 --> 00:22:30,791
chain of command.

420
00:22:30,957 --> 00:22:32,584
You're not at university any longer.

421
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:36,161
You are a very small cog in a very large system.

422
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,856
And you will do as your commanding officer instructs.

423
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:46,032
Who-who is your commanding officer?

424
00:22:46,206 --> 00:22:48,038
Winston Churchill,

425
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:49,471
Number 1O Downing Street,

426
00:22:49,643 --> 00:22:51,202
London, SW1 .

427
00:22:51,378 --> 00:22:53,005
You have a problem with my decision,

428
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,342
you can take it up with him.

429
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,110
Mr. Menzies!

430
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:05,486
Mr. Menzies!

431
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:08,959
A-A-Are you going to London?

432
00:23:09,129 --> 00:23:10,893
Possibly.

433
00:23:11,064 --> 00:23:14,500
Would you deliver a letter for me?

434
00:23:20,173 --> 00:23:21,299
Look, I'm sorry,

435
00:23:21,475 --> 00:23:22,772
but are you joking?

436
00:23:22,976 --> 00:23:25,001
Churchill's put Alan in charge?

437
00:23:25,178 --> 00:23:27,704
- This is a terrible idea.
-No, no, no, no, no.

438
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:30,248
So I can give these men orders now?

439
00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:32,351
I hate to say it, but yes.

440
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:34,351
Excellent. Keith and Charles,you're both fired.

441
00:23:35,655 --> 00:23:36,850
- Excuse me?
-What?

442
00:23:37,023 --> 00:23:38,320
You're mediocre linguists,

443
00:23:38,492 --> 00:23:40,824
and positively poor code-breakers.

444
00:23:40,994 --> 00:23:42,393
Alan, you can't just fire Keith and Charles.

445
00:23:42,562 --> 00:23:43,927
Well, he just said I could.

446
00:23:44,097 --> 00:23:45,326
No, I did no such thing.

447
00:23:45,499 --> 00:23:47,024
But Churchill did.

448
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,611
Go to hell.

449
00:24:03,183 --> 00:24:05,208
Well,

450
00:24:05,385 --> 00:24:07,080
this is inhuman.

451
00:24:07,254 --> 00:24:08,779
Even for you.

452
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:15,690
Popular at school, were you?

453
00:24:21,535 --> 00:24:23,025
The problem began, of course,

454
00:24:23,203 --> 00:24:25,194
with the carrots.

455
00:24:25,372 --> 00:24:27,204
Carrots are orange.

456
00:24:27,374 --> 00:24:28,739
And peas

457
00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:30,104
are green.

458
00:24:30,277 --> 00:24:32,109
They mustn't touch.

459
00:24:51,097 --> 00:24:52,758
I got it.

460
00:24:55,969 --> 00:24:57,334
Do you know why people

461
00:24:57,504 --> 00:24:58,630
like violence?

462
00:24:58,805 --> 00:25:01,672
It is because it feels...

463
00:25:01,842 --> 00:25:02,832
good.

464
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:05,137
Humans find violence

465
00:25:05,312 --> 00:25:07,337
deeply satisfying.

466
00:25:07,514 --> 00:25:11,144
But remove the-the satisfaction,

467
00:25:11,318 --> 00:25:14,151
and the act becomes...

468
00:25:14,321 --> 00:25:16,847
hollow.

469
00:25:22,329 --> 00:25:24,491
Tuflng?

470
00:25:24,664 --> 00:25:26,689
Come on.

471
00:25:26,867 --> 00:25:28,164
Don't be such a kike about it.

472
00:25:30,537 --> 00:25:32,335
Leave him to bloody rot.

473
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,645
I didn't learn this on my own,

474
00:25:39,813 --> 00:25:41,212
of course.

475
00:25:41,381 --> 00:25:42,507
I had help.

476
00:25:42,682 --> 00:25:46,141
Christopher helped.

477
00:25:47,487 --> 00:25:48,818
Alan, are you all right?

478
00:25:55,629 --> 00:25:57,119
It's not my fault.

479
00:25:57,297 --> 00:25:59,994
The carrots got in with the peas and...

480
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:01,292
I'm sorry.

481
00:26:01,468 --> 00:26:02,663
I won't let them do it again.

482
00:26:02,836 --> 00:26:04,395
They're getting worse.

483
00:26:04,571 --> 00:26:07,006
They only beat me up because I'm smarter than they are.

484
00:26:07,173 --> 00:26:09,403
No, they beat you up because you're different.

485
00:26:09,576 --> 00:26:11,635
Mother says I'm just an odd duck.

486
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:13,836
And she's right.

487
00:26:14,014 --> 00:26:15,846
But you know, Alan,

488
00:26:16,016 --> 00:26:18,917
sometimes it's the very people who no one imagines anything of

489
00:26:19,085 --> 00:26:21,649
who do the things no one can imagine.

490
00:26:27,994 --> 00:26:30,725
So, what do we do now?

491
00:26:30,897 --> 00:26:32,888
We're short on staff.

492
00:26:33,066 --> 00:26:34,431
Well, we, uh, we get

493
00:26:34,601 --> 00:26:35,864
more staff then.

494
00:26:36,036 --> 00:26:37,902
And how do you propose to do that?

495
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:51,769

496
00:26:51,288 --> 00:26:54,388

497
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:08,185
Um, Alan Turing

498
00:29:08,354 --> 00:29:09,981
to see Stewart Menzies.

499
00:29:10,156 --> 00:29:11,521
Very good, sir.

500
00:29:11,691 --> 00:29:13,659
So who are they?

501
00:29:13,827 --> 00:29:15,090
Oh, all sorts, really.

502
00:29:15,261 --> 00:29:16,888
Teacher, an engineer,

503
00:29:17,063 --> 00:29:18,656
a handful of students.

504
00:29:18,832 --> 00:29:20,322
And you think they're qualified for Bletchley

505
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,059
'cause they're good at crossword puzzles?

506
00:29:22,235 --> 00:29:24,226
Well, they say they're good,and now we shall find out,

507
00:29:24,404 --> 00:29:25,872

508
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,666
In order to aid your efforts,

509
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:30,203
there is, to the right of you,a green scratch card book.

510
00:29:30,376 --> 00:29:31,741
You are to make notes in that.

511
00:29:31,911 --> 00:29:33,436
Gentlemen, you have six minutes

512
00:29:33,613 --> 00:29:35,581
in which to complete the puzzle, at which point,

513
00:29:35,749 --> 00:29:36,739
I will...

514
00:29:39,619 --> 00:29:40,711
Pardon, ma'am,this room's restricted.

515
00:29:40,887 --> 00:29:42,218
Oh, apologies for my tardiness.

516
00:29:42,388 --> 00:29:43,378
The-the bus caught a flat tire.

517
00:29:43,556 --> 00:29:46,048
Uh, may I continue, please?

518
00:29:46,226 --> 00:29:48,024
- Thank you.
-You're not allowed in here, ma'am.

519
00:29:48,194 --> 00:29:49,821
Oh, but I'm only a few minutes late.

520
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:51,554
The secretaries are to head upstairs.

521
00:29:51,731 --> 00:29:53,256
This room's for the candidates.

522
00:29:53,433 --> 00:29:55,401
May I get on with this now, please?

523
00:29:55,568 --> 00:29:57,900
L-I am a candidate.

524
00:29:58,071 --> 00:29:59,061
For what position?

525
00:29:59,239 --> 00:30:00,400
The letter didn't say precisely.

526
00:30:00,573 --> 00:30:01,870
Yeah, so secretaries are to head upstairs.

527
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:03,634
It did say that it was top secret.

528
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,369
What is going on?

529
00:30:05,545 --> 00:30:06,740
L-I solved

530
00:30:06,913 --> 00:30:08,312
a-a crossword puzzle in the newspaper,

531
00:30:08,481 --> 00:30:10,040
and I-l got this letter saying

532
00:30:10,216 --> 00:30:12,310
that I was a candidate for some sort of mysterious job.

533
00:30:12,485 --> 00:30:14,078
My name's Joan Clarke.

534
00:30:14,254 --> 00:30:17,918
Miss, did you really solve this puzzle yourself?

535
00:30:19,826 --> 00:30:21,760
What makes you think I couldn't solve the puzzle myself?

536
00:30:21,928 --> 00:30:23,418
- L-I'm really very good at...
-Ma'am,

537
00:30:23,596 --> 00:30:24,757
- I'll have to ask you to...
-Miss Clarke,

538
00:30:24,931 --> 00:30:26,399
I-I find tardiness

539
00:30:26,566 --> 00:30:31,128
under any circumstance,um, unacceptable.

540
00:30:32,772 --> 00:30:36,504

541
00:30:38,812 --> 00:30:40,678
Thank you.

542
00:30:41,681 --> 00:30:42,773
Now, um,

543
00:30:42,949 --> 00:30:44,974
as I was saying,you-you have six minutes

544
00:30:45,151 --> 00:30:48,121
to, uh, complete the task in front of you.

545
00:30:48,288 --> 00:30:50,985
Uh, gentlemen and lady,

546
00:30:51,157 --> 00:30:53,751
begin.

547
00:31:20,653 --> 00:31:23,213
Six minutes.

548
00:31:23,389 --> 00:31:24,652
Is that even possible?

549
00:31:24,824 --> 00:31:26,883
No, it takes me eight.

550
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,824
This isn't about crossword puzzles.

551
00:31:28,995 --> 00:31:30,360
It's about how one, uh,

552
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,191
approaches solving an impossible problem.

553
00:31:32,365 --> 00:31:35,198
Do you tackle the whole thing at once or divide it

554
00:31:35,368 --> 00:31:37,860
into small...

555
00:31:38,037 --> 00:31:39,402
You've finished?

556
00:31:39,572 --> 00:31:41,563
Yes.

557
00:31:55,054 --> 00:31:57,250
Five minutes and 34 seconds.

558
00:31:57,423 --> 00:32:00,688
You said to do it in under six.

559
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,658
Congratulations.

560
00:32:02,829 --> 00:32:05,764
My warmest welcome to His Majesty's service.

561
00:32:05,932 --> 00:32:08,162
If you speak a word of what I'm about to show you,

562
00:32:08,334 --> 00:32:10,166
you will be executed for high treason.

563
00:32:11,237 --> 00:32:12,671
You will lie to your friends,

564
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:14,603
your family and everyone you meet

565
00:32:14,774 --> 00:32:17,106
about what it is you really do.

566
00:32:18,611 --> 00:32:21,273
And what is it that we're really doing?

567
00:32:21,447 --> 00:32:23,347
We're going to break an unbreakable Nazi code

568
00:32:23,516 --> 00:32:25,109
and win the war.

569
00:32:25,285 --> 00:32:27,515
Oh.

570
00:32:36,629 --> 00:32:39,257
What's that you're reading?

571
00:32:39,432 --> 00:32:41,696
It's about cryptography.

572
00:32:41,868 --> 00:32:43,336
Like secret messages?

573
00:32:43,536 --> 00:32:45,595
Not secret.

574
00:32:45,772 --> 00:32:47,638
That's the brilliant part.

575
00:32:47,807 --> 00:32:50,902
Messages that anyone can see,but no one knows what they mean

576
00:32:51,077 --> 00:32:53,068
unless you have the key.

577
00:32:58,418 --> 00:33:01,410
How's that different from talking?

578
00:33:01,587 --> 00:33:03,453
- Talking?
-When people talk to each other,

579
00:33:03,623 --> 00:33:04,784
they never say what they mean.

580
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:06,426
They say something else,

581
00:33:06,592 --> 00:33:08,890
and you're expected to just know what they mean.

582
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:11,497
Only I never do.

583
00:33:11,664 --> 00:33:15,259
So, how's that different?

584
00:33:16,502 --> 00:33:17,901
Alan, I have a funny feeling

585
00:33:18,071 --> 00:33:19,971
you're going to be very good at this.

586
00:33:45,965 --> 00:33:47,330
Good night, Alan.

587
00:33:51,971 --> 00:33:53,939
Good night.

588
00:34:06,019 --> 00:34:08,215
Hold on,Marion, I'm coming!

589
00:34:08,388 --> 00:34:10,356
Coming round the lesser settings and then route back through...

590
00:34:10,523 --> 00:34:11,991
Back to those ones...

591
00:34:12,158 --> 00:34:13,956
Uh, careful, will you?

592
00:34:14,127 --> 00:34:15,686
Um, it-it's not a toy.

593
00:34:15,862 --> 00:34:17,193
Funny.

594
00:34:17,363 --> 00:34:18,353
Looks like a toy.

595
00:34:18,531 --> 00:34:20,863
Bloody great 100,000-pound one.

596
00:34:21,034 --> 00:34:22,661
Your new minion's arrived.

597
00:34:22,835 --> 00:34:23,996
Jack Good. We met...

598
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:26,502
Well, where's Miss Clarke?

599
00:34:28,674 --> 00:34:30,972
Lovely, isn't he?

600
00:34:31,144 --> 00:34:35,980
It's not just a-a usual humdrum production mill factory.

601
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:37,310
I mean, well,as-as I was saying,

602
00:34:37,483 --> 00:34:40,748
it's a very important,uh, radio factory.

603
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,150
I-It's not, actually.Uh, well, um,

604
00:34:43,322 --> 00:34:45,723
on the spectrum of,uh... radio factories,

605
00:34:45,892 --> 00:34:48,554
this-this one is-is particularly...

606
00:34:59,005 --> 00:35:01,337
Why are you not at Bletchley?

607
00:35:01,507 --> 00:35:04,374
Thank you... so much for your visit, Mr. Turing.

608
00:35:04,544 --> 00:35:06,740
- Was your trip pleasant?
-Gather your things and let's go.

609
00:35:06,913 --> 00:35:09,746
I'm sorry, but I'm unable to accept your offer.

610
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:11,884
We feel that such a position

611
00:35:12,051 --> 00:35:13,576
would hardly be appropriate.

612
00:35:13,753 --> 00:35:15,881
You earned a double first in mathematics.

613
00:35:16,055 --> 00:35:18,854
But sadly wasn't granted the opportunity to become a Fellow.

614
00:35:19,025 --> 00:35:20,891
You belong at Bletchley.

615
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,495
I'm sorry,but for someone in my position

616
00:35:23,696 --> 00:35:25,926
to live... to...

617
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:28,966
to work in a radio factory so far from home,

618
00:35:29,135 --> 00:35:31,126
with all your men, um...

619
00:35:31,304 --> 00:35:33,432
it-it would be...

620
00:35:33,606 --> 00:35:35,370
indecorous.

621
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,437
What in the world does that even mean?

622
00:35:44,317 --> 00:35:46,376
We have a group of,uh, young ladies

623
00:35:46,552 --> 00:35:48,179
who tend to all of our

624
00:35:48,387 --> 00:35:51,152
clerical tasks:assistants, translators.

625
00:35:51,324 --> 00:35:53,725
Uh, they live,um, together in town.

626
00:35:53,893 --> 00:35:57,955
W-W-Would that be a more,uh, suitable environment?

627
00:35:58,131 --> 00:36:01,999
Hm. So-so I would be working amongst these women?

628
00:36:02,168 --> 00:36:03,658
Yes.

629
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:08,901
Wonderful ladies. Uh, they even organize social events

630
00:36:09,075 --> 00:36:11,407
at St. Martin's Church down the road.

631
00:36:11,577 --> 00:36:13,671
Uh, really, the whole thing is-is quite, uh...

632
00:36:13,846 --> 00:36:15,075
uh, um...

633
00:36:15,248 --> 00:36:17,580
decorous.

634
00:36:21,954 --> 00:36:23,615
Now, you won't have proper security clearance,

635
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:26,520
of course, so, uh, we'll have to improvise things a bit.

636
00:36:26,692 --> 00:36:28,126
Why are you helping me?

637
00:36:28,294 --> 00:36:30,194
Because there is only one thing that matters

638
00:36:30,363 --> 00:36:32,422
in this entire world right now... do you understand?...

639
00:36:32,598 --> 00:36:33,963
and that is breaking Enigma.

640
00:36:34,133 --> 00:36:37,103
But-but, Mr. Turing...

641
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,329
why are you helping me?

642
00:36:39,505 --> 00:36:42,668
Oh. Um...

643
00:36:42,842 --> 00:36:46,107
sometimes it's the very people who no one imagines anything of

644
00:36:46,279 --> 00:36:49,840
who do the things that no one can imagine.

645
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,834
Sir.

646
00:37:10,002 --> 00:37:10,992
What's this?

647
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:14,231
Alan Turing's classified military file.

648
00:37:14,407 --> 00:37:17,377
- It's bloody empty.
-Exactly.

649
00:37:17,543 --> 00:37:20,672
- It's an empty manila envelope.
-Yeah.

650
00:37:20,846 --> 00:37:23,611
Well, you've cracked the case wide open, then, haven't you?

651
00:37:23,816 --> 00:37:26,012
Alan Turing's war records aren't just classified,

652
00:37:26,185 --> 00:37:27,846
they're nonexistent.

653
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,920
That means someone's got rid of them.

654
00:37:30,089 --> 00:37:31,682
Erased them.Burned them.

655
00:37:31,857 --> 00:37:35,054
And that same person broke into his house and stole nothing?

656
00:37:36,495 --> 00:37:38,657
Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean.

657
00:37:38,831 --> 00:37:40,196
What the spies from the papers?

658
00:37:40,366 --> 00:37:41,697
The Soviet spies.

659
00:37:41,867 --> 00:37:45,201
But first they were professors, weren't they?

660
00:37:45,371 --> 00:37:47,271
Radicalized at Cambridge,

661
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,737
then they joined the Communist Party,

662
00:37:48,908 --> 00:37:50,603
then Foreign Office,then leaked information

663
00:37:50,776 --> 00:37:52,608
to Stalin during the war... now

664
00:37:52,778 --> 00:37:55,179
can you think of anyone else we know who was at Cambridge,

665
00:37:55,348 --> 00:37:58,249
then took up something murky and top secret when war broke out?

666
00:37:58,417 --> 00:38:01,284
You think this Alan Turing might be a Soviet agent?

667
00:38:01,454 --> 00:38:02,615
I think...

668
00:38:02,788 --> 00:38:04,779
something very serious is happening

669
00:38:04,957 --> 00:38:07,551
right here under our noses.

670
00:38:07,727 --> 00:38:10,594
Wouldn't you like to find out what it is?

671
00:38:42,395 --> 00:38:43,829
Welcome, ladies.

672
00:38:43,996 --> 00:38:45,828
If you'd like to follow me.

673
00:38:45,998 --> 00:38:48,626
Some people thought we were at war

674
00:38:48,801 --> 00:38:51,099
with the Germans... incorrect.

675
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:53,602
We were at war with the clock.

676
00:38:53,773 --> 00:38:56,265
Britain was literally starving to death.

677
00:38:56,442 --> 00:38:58,171
The Americans sent over

678
00:38:58,344 --> 00:39:01,974
100,000 tons of food every week,and, uh, every week

679
00:39:02,148 --> 00:39:04,640
the Germans would send our desperately needed bread

680
00:39:04,817 --> 00:39:06,410
to the bottom of the ocean.

681
00:39:06,585 --> 00:39:10,749
Our daily failure was announced at the chimes of midnight.

682
00:39:10,923 --> 00:39:14,689
And the sound would haunt our unwelcome dreams.

683
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,089
Tick...

684
00:39:16,262 --> 00:39:17,286
tock...

685
00:39:17,463 --> 00:39:18,487
tick.

686
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,763
Damn it!

687
00:39:28,274 --> 00:39:30,834
- What just happened?
-Midnight...

688
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:33,172
all the work we've done today is useless.

689
00:39:33,346 --> 00:39:35,610
Oh, but don't worry,we've a few hours

690
00:39:35,781 --> 00:39:38,045
before tomorrow's messages start flooding in...

691
00:39:38,217 --> 00:39:40,379
and we start all over again.

692
00:39:41,821 --> 00:39:43,220
From scratch.

693
00:39:43,389 --> 00:39:44,618
I'm so sick of this.

694
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:47,316
Four hours rewiring his plugboard matrix.

695
00:39:47,493 --> 00:39:48,654
Three hours yesterday

696
00:39:48,828 --> 00:39:50,819
on his rotor positions!

697
00:39:50,996 --> 00:39:53,727
- Don't go over there.
-Look, John, no.

698
00:39:53,899 --> 00:39:55,560
If this job wasn't already impossible before,

699
00:39:55,735 --> 00:39:58,397
- it bloody well is now.
-Hugh, don't.

700
00:40:06,312 --> 00:40:09,145
Damn you and your useless machine.

701
00:40:09,315 --> 00:40:12,808
My machine is how we are going to win.

702
00:40:12,985 --> 00:40:14,043
Really?

703
00:40:15,488 --> 00:40:18,048
This machine? Hmm?

704
00:40:18,224 --> 00:40:20,488
Are you talking about this bloody machine?!

705
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:22,286
- Hugh! Hugh! Hugh, don't!
-Hugh! Hugh! Stop!

706
00:40:22,495 --> 00:40:24,657
You arrogant bastard.

707
00:40:24,897 --> 00:40:26,262
You could help us.

708
00:40:26,432 --> 00:40:28,594
You could make this go faster, but you won't.

709
00:40:30,436 --> 00:40:31,926
Get off.

710
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:39,674
He's right, Alan.

711
00:40:39,845 --> 00:40:41,939
There are...

712
00:40:42,114 --> 00:40:45,106
actual soldiers out there trying to win an actual war.

713
00:40:45,284 --> 00:40:46,410
My brother

714
00:40:46,585 --> 00:40:49,077
protects food convoys in the Navy.

715
00:40:49,255 --> 00:40:52,020
My cousins fly RAF patrols.

716
00:40:52,191 --> 00:40:54,592
All my friends,they're all making a difference,

717
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,390
while we just...while away our days

718
00:40:58,564 --> 00:41:00,623
producing nothing.

719
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,326
Because of you.

720
00:41:04,637 --> 00:41:06,799
My machine...

721
00:41:06,972 --> 00:41:09,407
will work.

722
00:41:09,575 --> 00:41:11,703
Come on, Peter.

723
00:41:51,851 --> 00:41:53,410
Okay

724
00:42:21,981 --> 00:42:23,949
Joan?

725
00:42:34,627 --> 00:42:36,186
Oh.

726
00:42:44,503 --> 00:42:46,835
Uh, will you...

727
00:42:48,807 --> 00:42:51,367
Could you make

728
00:42:51,544 --> 00:42:52,670
a bit more noise? I'm not quite sure

729
00:42:52,845 --> 00:42:53,869
- my landlady woke up.
-Oh, sorry.

730
00:42:54,547 --> 00:42:56,208
Oh, uh, look.

731
00:42:56,382 --> 00:42:58,248
I think that's the best I can do.

732
00:42:58,417 --> 00:42:59,816
No male visitors after dark.

733
00:42:59,985 --> 00:43:01,578
So...

734
00:43:01,754 --> 00:43:04,052
what did you bring me?

735
00:43:04,223 --> 00:43:05,657
There you go.

736
00:43:05,824 --> 00:43:07,189
Here.

737
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:10,090
Some men try flowers, you know.

738
00:43:10,262 --> 00:43:12,754
These are actual decrypted Enigma messages

739
00:43:12,932 --> 00:43:14,400
direct from Nazi

740
00:43:14,567 --> 00:43:15,796
High Command.

741
00:43:16,001 --> 00:43:17,264
"0600 hours.

742
00:43:17,436 --> 00:43:19,097
"Weather today is clear.

743
00:43:19,271 --> 00:43:20,739
"Rain in the evening.

744
00:43:20,906 --> 00:43:22,271
Heil Hitler."

745
00:43:22,441 --> 00:43:24,102
Well, clearly,that vital piece of information

746
00:43:24,276 --> 00:43:26,005
is going to win us the war.

747
00:43:26,178 --> 00:43:28,146
It's the relationship between the encrypted

748
00:43:28,347 --> 00:43:31,078
a-and decrypted messages that interests me.

749
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:34,845
Can we find a clue here that we can build into Christopher?

750
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,078
Who's Christopher?

751
00:43:36,255 --> 00:43:38,280
Oh, he's, uh,he's my machine.

752
00:43:38,457 --> 00:43:39,925
You named him?

753
00:43:40,092 --> 00:43:42,561
Is that a bad name?

754
00:43:42,728 --> 00:43:44,196
No.

755
00:43:45,631 --> 00:43:47,429
No, never mind.

756
00:43:53,238 --> 00:43:56,037
Are you trying to build your universal machine?

757
00:43:57,543 --> 00:43:59,102
I read your paper

758
00:43:59,278 --> 00:44:01,474
- at university.
-Is it already being taught?

759
00:44:01,647 --> 00:44:03,741
No. No. No, I was precocious.

760
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:05,475
So...

761
00:44:05,651 --> 00:44:07,483
you-you theorized a machine that

762
00:44:07,653 --> 00:44:09,121
could solve any problem.

763
00:44:09,288 --> 00:44:11,154
It didn't just do one thing,it did everything.

764
00:44:11,323 --> 00:44:13,417
It wasn't just programmable,it was reprogrammable.

765
00:44:13,592 --> 00:44:14,616
Mm.

766
00:44:14,793 --> 00:44:17,057
Is that your idea behind Christopher?

767
00:44:17,229 --> 00:44:21,427
Well, human brains can compute large sums very quickly...

768
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,763
even Hugh can do that... but I want Christopher to be smarter.

769
00:44:24,937 --> 00:44:27,463
To make a calculation and then, uh...

770
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,972
to determine what to do next.

771
00:44:30,142 --> 00:44:32,304
Like a person does.

772
00:44:32,478 --> 00:44:34,139
Think of it.

773
00:44:34,313 --> 00:44:36,077
Electrical brain.

774
00:44:36,248 --> 00:44:38,842
A digital computer.

775
00:44:39,018 --> 00:44:40,952
Digital computer.

776
00:44:42,421 --> 00:44:44,150
Hmm.

777
00:44:56,135 --> 00:44:59,503
What's going on?

778
00:44:59,672 --> 00:45:01,197
What's happening?

779
00:45:01,373 --> 00:45:03,501
No. No, no. No, no, no!Don't touch that!

780
00:45:03,676 --> 00:45:05,201
- Stay back.
-That's my desk.

781
00:45:05,377 --> 00:45:06,776
Thank goodness.

782
00:45:06,945 --> 00:45:08,538
I'd hate to think we were searching

783
00:45:08,714 --> 00:45:11,046
- the wrong one.
-What are you doing? What's going on?

784
00:45:11,216 --> 00:45:13,048
There is a spy

785
00:45:13,218 --> 00:45:14,549
in Bletchley Park.

786
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,017
The Navy thinks that one of us

787
00:45:16,188 --> 00:45:17,280
is a Soviet double agent, Alan.

788
00:45:17,456 --> 00:45:19,481
Uh...why?

789
00:45:19,658 --> 00:45:22,958
Our boys intercepted this on its way to Moscow.

790
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,029
Look familiar?

791
00:45:28,467 --> 00:45:29,901
It's a Beale cipher.

792
00:45:30,069 --> 00:45:34,370
Encrypted with a phrase from a book or a poem or...

793
00:45:40,846 --> 00:45:44,339
You don't seriously think I did this, do you?

794
00:45:44,516 --> 00:45:46,575
Double agents are such bastards.

795
00:45:46,752 --> 00:45:48,686
Isolated loners.

796
00:45:48,854 --> 00:45:51,255
No attachments to friends or family.

797
00:45:51,423 --> 00:45:53,551
Arrogant.

798
00:45:53,726 --> 00:45:55,660
Know anybody like that?

799
00:46:00,165 --> 00:46:02,133
Hm, I know you don't like me,

800
00:46:02,334 --> 00:46:04,735
but that does not make me

801
00:46:04,903 --> 00:46:06,735
a Soviet spy.

802
00:46:06,905 --> 00:46:09,738
Nothing out of the ordinary, sir.

803
00:46:09,908 --> 00:46:11,672
Really.

804
00:46:11,844 --> 00:46:13,005
Mm, all right.

805
00:46:15,748 --> 00:46:17,614
The Home Office may be protecting you now,

806
00:46:17,783 --> 00:46:19,046
but sooner or later

807
00:46:19,218 --> 00:46:20,617
you will make a mistake.

808
00:46:20,786 --> 00:46:23,551
And I needn't bother firing you.

809
00:46:23,722 --> 00:46:26,851
They will hang you for treason.

810
00:46:46,745 --> 00:46:48,474
Hello.

811
00:46:50,282 --> 00:46:52,614
I heard about what happened.

812
00:46:52,785 --> 00:46:56,585
It's all the girls in Hut 3 can talk about.

813
00:46:56,755 --> 00:47:00,555
I have an idea of what might cheer you up.

814
00:47:02,561 --> 00:47:04,222
So because no letter

815
00:47:04,396 --> 00:47:06,330
can be encoded as itself,there's already a handful

816
00:47:06,498 --> 00:47:08,660
of settings that can be rejected at the outset.

817
00:47:13,138 --> 00:47:15,004
Is that your team?

818
00:47:15,174 --> 00:47:16,835
- Y-Yes.
-Shall we say hello?

819
00:47:17,009 --> 00:47:18,408
- No.
-Hello.

820
00:47:19,678 --> 00:47:21,407
L-I told you not to do that.

821
00:47:23,081 --> 00:47:25,175
- Alan.
-Uh, Hugh, h-hello.

822
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:27,114
- Didn't know you drank.
-He doesn't, really.

823
00:47:27,286 --> 00:47:28,845
He just sort of sips at the foam.

824
00:47:29,021 --> 00:47:30,750
Well, I'll let you into a little secret, Miss...?

825
00:47:30,923 --> 00:47:31,913
Clarke.

826
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:33,319
- Miss Clarke.
-Please.

827
00:47:33,492 --> 00:47:35,256
Foam's my favorite part, too.

828
00:47:35,427 --> 00:47:36,519
Is it really?

829
00:47:36,695 --> 00:47:38,129
Come and join us for a drink?

830
00:47:38,297 --> 00:47:39,594
We'll be there in a moment.

831
00:47:39,765 --> 00:47:41,824
Miss Clarke.

832
00:47:46,705 --> 00:47:48,537
Well, he likes you.

833
00:47:48,707 --> 00:47:50,471
- Yes. -You...

834
00:47:50,642 --> 00:47:54,272
g-got him to like you.

835
00:47:54,446 --> 00:47:55,777
Yes.

836
00:47:55,948 --> 00:47:57,211
Why?

837
00:47:57,382 --> 00:47:59,282
Because I'm a woman in a man's job,

838
00:47:59,451 --> 00:48:01,852
and I don't have the luxury of being an ass.

839
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,954
Alan...

840
00:48:04,122 --> 00:48:06,284
it doesn't matter how smart you are,

841
00:48:06,458 --> 00:48:08,392
Enigma is always smarter.

842
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,050
If you really

843
00:48:10,229 --> 00:48:11,526
want to solve your puzzle,

844
00:48:11,697 --> 00:48:13,665
then you're going to need all the help

845
00:48:13,832 --> 00:48:15,857
you can get,and they are not going

846
00:48:16,034 --> 00:48:19,470
to help you if they do not like you.

847
00:48:26,144 --> 00:48:29,341
- What are those?
-Apples.

848
00:48:29,514 --> 00:48:31,710
- No.
-Oh, they really are.

849
00:48:31,884 --> 00:48:35,821
Um, l... well, Miss Clarke,Joan actually, um...

850
00:48:35,988 --> 00:48:37,820
said that it would be...

851
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:40,482
Nice if I was to, uh,bring you all something.

852
00:48:40,659 --> 00:48:42,093
So here we are. I...

853
00:48:42,261 --> 00:48:43,353
Thank you.

854
00:48:43,528 --> 00:48:45,189
I like apples.

855
00:48:45,364 --> 00:48:47,196
My best to Miss Clarke.

856
00:48:47,366 --> 00:48:49,334
Uh, there are two people in a wood,

857
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,527
and, um, they run into a bear.

858
00:48:51,703 --> 00:48:54,070
The first person gets down on his knees to pray.

859
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:56,037
The second person starts lacing up his boots.

860
00:48:56,208 --> 00:48:57,835
The first person asks the second person,

861
00:48:58,010 --> 00:48:59,535
"My dear friend,what are you doing?

862
00:48:59,711 --> 00:49:01,236
You-you-you can't outrun a bear."

863
00:49:01,413 --> 00:49:03,211
Uh, to which the second person responds,

864
00:49:03,382 --> 00:49:04,543
"I don't have to.

865
00:49:04,716 --> 00:49:07,742
I only have to outrun you."

866
00:49:17,262 --> 00:49:20,232
I'll be w-with Christopher, if anyone needs me.

867
00:49:20,399 --> 00:49:23,334
If we assume that the square root of two

868
00:49:23,535 --> 00:49:26,732
is a rational number,then we can say

869
00:49:26,905 --> 00:49:29,033
that the square root of two

870
00:49:29,207 --> 00:49:31,539
is A over B...

871
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:33,872
where A and B

872
00:49:34,046 --> 00:49:37,482
are whole numbers and B is not zero.

873
00:49:37,649 --> 00:49:39,640
Mr. Turing,passing notes, are we?

874
00:49:39,818 --> 00:49:41,377
No, sir.

875
00:49:45,924 --> 00:49:50,828
Only Turing would pass notes written in gibberish.

876
00:49:56,168 --> 00:49:57,397
All right, gentlemen,

877
00:49:57,569 --> 00:50:00,061
do not forget your algebra over the break.

878
00:50:00,238 --> 00:50:03,799
Have a pleasant holiday,and we'll resume

879
00:50:03,976 --> 00:50:07,139
your irrationals when you return.

880
00:50:23,245 --> 00:50:26,245

881
00:50:38,643 --> 00:50:40,111
Mm.

882
00:50:42,114 --> 00:50:44,640
But Euler's Theorem gives you that immediately.

883
00:50:44,816 --> 00:50:47,012
Um...

884
00:50:55,861 --> 00:50:57,693
Here. Look at this.

885
00:50:59,531 --> 00:51:02,933
If you run the wires across the plugboard matrix diagonally,

886
00:51:03,135 --> 00:51:06,036
it will eliminate rotor positions 500 times faster.

887
00:51:06,204 --> 00:51:08,366
That's, uh...

888
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:11,032
actually not an entirely terrible idea.

889
00:51:13,178 --> 00:51:15,340
I think that was Alan for "thank you."

890
00:51:19,251 --> 00:51:20,685
Uh, th-that's my sandwich.

891
00:51:20,852 --> 00:51:23,082
You don't like sandwiches.

892
00:51:36,334 --> 00:51:38,428
You nervous?

893
00:52:01,226 --> 00:52:03,695
What happens now?

894
00:52:03,862 --> 00:52:07,560
It-it should work out the day's Enigma settings.

895
00:52:22,647 --> 00:52:24,638
How long?

896
00:52:37,295 --> 00:52:41,493
Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil!

897
00:52:41,666 --> 00:52:44,465
The German Army has fanned out across Europe,

898
00:52:44,636 --> 00:52:47,333
from Poland to Serbia,Lithuania to Denmark,

899
00:52:47,506 --> 00:52:48,769
Norway to France.

900
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:51,773
The Nazi flag now flies from more than two dozen

901
00:52:51,943 --> 00:52:53,502
national capitals.

902
00:52:53,678 --> 00:52:55,407
Their campaign mounts in fury

903
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:57,309
as a free Europe crumbles.

904
00:53:37,822 --> 00:53:40,314
Oh, it's still going.

905
00:53:40,492 --> 00:53:42,221
- Good morning, sir.
-Morning, Margaret.

906
00:53:42,394 --> 00:53:44,226
Gears keep spinning on and on.

907
00:53:44,396 --> 00:53:46,160
Rotors on and on.

908
00:53:46,331 --> 00:53:47,890
It's endless.

909
00:53:48,066 --> 00:53:50,797
With no result in sight?

910
00:53:50,969 --> 00:53:52,368
No.

911
00:53:54,673 --> 00:53:57,734
Ow.

912
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:07,084
Turing.

913
00:54:18,363 --> 00:54:19,592
Turing,

914
00:54:19,764 --> 00:54:22,028
- open the bloody door.
-Uh, no.

915
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,668
No.

916
00:54:25,103 --> 00:54:26,935
Open the door or we'll break it down.

917
00:54:27,105 --> 00:54:30,735
I can't let you in! I-l...I cannot let you interfere.

918
00:54:30,909 --> 00:54:32,274
Go on, then.

919
00:54:39,584 --> 00:54:41,074
Turn that thing off.

920
00:54:41,253 --> 00:54:43,915
No. Don't, please. Please.

921
00:54:44,089 --> 00:54:45,716
Please! Please!

922
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:46,880
No!

923
00:54:47,058 --> 00:54:48,048
N-No. No!

924
00:54:48,226 --> 00:54:49,887
Don't!

925
00:54:52,797 --> 00:54:55,232
Well, then, it seems that your great big

926
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,698
expensive machine doesn't work.

927
00:54:59,237 --> 00:55:00,602
It does.

928
00:55:00,772 --> 00:55:01,967
Wonderful.

929
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:04,199
So you've broken Enigma, then?

930
00:55:04,376 --> 00:55:06,936
It was just...

931
00:55:07,112 --> 00:55:09,308
s-still working.

932
00:55:09,481 --> 00:55:11,711
This is my associate from the Home Office.

933
00:55:11,883 --> 00:55:13,510
You see, a hundred thousand pounds

934
00:55:13,718 --> 00:55:15,413
is rather a lot of money,

935
00:55:15,587 --> 00:55:18,579
and he's here to see what you have to show for it.

936
00:55:18,757 --> 00:55:21,988
You... will never understand

937
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:26,461
the importance of what I-l am creating here!

938
00:55:26,631 --> 00:55:29,828
Have you decrypted any German messages?

939
00:55:30,001 --> 00:55:32,629
A single one?

940
00:55:32,804 --> 00:55:36,434
Can you point to anything at all that you've achieved?

941
00:55:36,608 --> 00:55:39,839
Hmm. Your funding is up,

942
00:55:40,011 --> 00:55:42,309
and our patience is expired.

943
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,073
It's with such great pleasure

944
00:55:44,249 --> 00:55:46,513
that I am finally able to say this.

945
00:55:46,685 --> 00:55:50,087
Alan Turing,you're fired.

946
00:55:50,255 --> 00:55:54,158
Please escort Mr. Turing from the premises.

947
00:55:54,326 --> 00:55:57,261
No.

948
00:55:57,429 --> 00:55:59,693
I beg your pardon?

949
00:56:03,535 --> 00:56:07,438
If you fire Alan...

950
00:56:07,605 --> 00:56:09,699
well, then you'll have to fire me, too.

951
00:56:09,874 --> 00:56:12,536
What on earth are you saying?

952
00:56:12,711 --> 00:56:14,145
Trust me when I tell you there is no one

953
00:56:14,312 --> 00:56:17,612
who would rather say this less than I do, but...

954
00:56:18,283 --> 00:56:19,273
he's right.

955
00:56:19,451 --> 00:56:21,510
Alan is right.

956
00:56:21,686 --> 00:56:23,814
His machine can work,and it's probably

957
00:56:23,988 --> 00:56:25,888
the best chance that we've got.

958
00:56:26,057 --> 00:56:28,321
God, it's beyond belief.

959
00:56:28,493 --> 00:56:30,552
If you fire them...

960
00:56:30,729 --> 00:56:33,130
you'll have to fire me, too.

961
00:56:33,298 --> 00:56:35,027
And me.

962
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,363
We're the best cryptographic minds in Britain.

963
00:56:38,536 --> 00:56:40,504
Are you going to fire us all?

964
00:56:40,672 --> 00:56:43,073
Commander, at least give us some more time

965
00:56:43,241 --> 00:56:45,733
Six months, and if the machine doesn't produce

966
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:47,639
any results that we need,then we'll go back

967
00:56:47,812 --> 00:56:50,042
to doing things the old way...how about that?

968
00:56:56,755 --> 00:56:58,883
One month.

969
00:56:59,057 --> 00:57:00,491
And then,so help me God,

970
00:57:00,658 --> 00:57:02,524
you're all gone.

971
00:57:02,694 --> 00:57:04,389
Oh, leave him.

972
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:13,932
Thank you.

973
00:57:14,105 --> 00:57:15,436
You're welcome.

974
00:57:17,008 --> 00:57:18,840
Oh, and, Alan,your machine...

975
00:57:22,113 --> 00:57:23,842
...it better bloody work.

976
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:33,580
Hugh.

977
00:57:34,459 --> 00:57:35,949
I swear...

978
00:57:36,795 --> 00:57:40,129
I'm not a spy.

979
00:57:40,298 --> 00:57:42,926
Oh, for God's sake, of course you're not a bloody spy.

980
00:57:43,101 --> 00:57:44,262
What?

981
00:57:44,436 --> 00:57:45,801
Denniston gave me the Beale cipher,

982
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:47,131
and guess what?

983
00:57:47,305 --> 00:57:48,466
I cracked it.

984
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,870
"Ask, and it shall be given to you;

985
00:57:51,042 --> 00:57:53,443
seek and ye shall find." Matthew 7:7.

986
00:57:53,611 --> 00:57:55,909
That was the key.

987
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,981
Far too simple for the likes of you.

988
00:58:00,385 --> 00:58:03,047
Pity Denniston disagrees.

989
00:58:12,263 --> 00:58:14,630
Come in.

990
00:58:16,835 --> 00:58:19,327
Sir, I think I've got Turing.

991
00:58:19,504 --> 00:58:20,903
I tailed him

992
00:58:21,072 --> 00:58:23,370
to a pub last night,where he met a bloke.

993
00:58:23,575 --> 00:58:24,565
They exchanged an envelope.

994
00:58:24,742 --> 00:58:26,335
So I follow this other fella,

995
00:58:26,511 --> 00:58:28,138
pick him up,give him a good shake.

996
00:58:29,814 --> 00:58:32,112
He's a poofter.He confessed.

997
00:58:32,283 --> 00:58:33,614
What?

998
00:58:33,785 --> 00:58:36,015
The man admitted it.Arnold Murray.

999
00:58:36,187 --> 00:58:38,918
Hangs around that pub;men pay him for a go.

1000
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:40,785
Turing's one of the men that paid.

1001
00:58:40,959 --> 00:58:42,120
Only Mr. Murray here

1002
00:58:42,293 --> 00:58:43,988
then has the bright idea

1003
00:58:44,162 --> 00:58:46,961
of robbing Turing's house after, with a friend.

1004
00:58:47,131 --> 00:58:48,621
That's what Turing's hiding.

1005
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,962
Well, he's a poof, not a spy.

1006
00:58:51,135 --> 00:58:52,364
- No.
-What's the matter?

1007
00:58:52,537 --> 00:58:54,096
We can charge a university professor

1008
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:55,638
- with indecency.
-No, this is...

1009
00:58:55,807 --> 00:58:57,172
it's bloody rubbish.

1010
00:58:57,342 --> 00:58:58,332
Turing's up to something important...

1011
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:00,774
He's committed a crime and he's broken the law.

1012
00:59:00,945 --> 00:59:02,674
And with a bloke.Jesus Christ,

1013
00:59:02,847 --> 00:59:04,440
- it's bloody disgusting.
-This isn't

1014
00:59:04,616 --> 00:59:06,106
the investigation I was conducting.

1015
00:59:06,284 --> 00:59:08,378
Bring him in.

1016
00:59:08,553 --> 00:59:10,487
Wait.

1017
00:59:10,655 --> 00:59:11,645
L-Let me interrogate him.

1018
00:59:11,823 --> 00:59:13,951
Please. Give me half an hour alone,

1019
00:59:14,125 --> 00:59:15,957
and then I swear,I'll spend the next month

1020
00:59:16,127 --> 00:59:18,357
running errands on as many rubbish cases as you like.

1021
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:21,329
Fine. Now,will someone get me a warrant

1022
00:59:21,499 --> 00:59:23,524
for the arrest of Alan Turing.

1023
00:59:40,218 --> 00:59:41,379
Alan?

1024
00:59:41,553 --> 00:59:44,545
Christopher's simply not moving fast enough.

1025
00:59:44,722 --> 00:59:47,555
- We should talk.
-And even with the diagonal board,

1026
00:59:47,725 --> 00:59:49,250
he's still not eliminating settings as quickly

1027
00:59:49,427 --> 00:59:51,156
- as we need him to in order...
-I'm leaving.

1028
00:59:51,329 --> 00:59:52,990
But you've just walked in.

1029
00:59:53,164 --> 00:59:54,256
No.

1030
00:59:54,432 --> 00:59:56,196
No. Bletchley.

1031
00:59:56,367 --> 00:59:57,425
What?

1032
00:59:57,602 --> 00:59:58,865
It's my parents.

1033
00:59:59,037 --> 01:00:01,335
I'm 25, I'm unmarried,I'm living alone,

1034
01:00:01,506 --> 01:00:02,735
and they want me home.

1035
01:00:02,907 --> 01:00:04,898
That's ridiculous.

1036
01:00:05,076 --> 01:00:06,669
That's my parents.

1037
01:00:06,844 --> 01:00:10,337
You... you can't leave...l-l won't let you.

1038
01:00:10,515 --> 01:00:13,382
"I'll miss you." That's what a normal person

1039
01:00:13,551 --> 01:00:16,179
- might say in this situation.
-I-l don't care what is normal.

1040
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:17,584
What am I supposed

1041
01:00:17,755 --> 01:00:20,747
to do, Alan?

1042
01:00:20,925 --> 01:00:22,484
L-I will not...

1043
01:00:22,694 --> 01:00:24,184
give up my parents.

1044
01:00:25,229 --> 01:00:27,630
You... you have an opportunity here

1045
01:00:27,799 --> 01:00:29,631
to make some actual use of your life.

1046
01:00:29,801 --> 01:00:32,429
And end up like you?No, thanks.

1047
01:00:32,604 --> 01:00:34,732
I'm sorry you're lonely.

1048
01:00:34,906 --> 01:00:38,069
But Enigma will not save you.

1049
01:00:38,242 --> 01:00:40,802
Can you decipher that,you fragile narcissist?

1050
01:00:40,979 --> 01:00:42,003
Or would you like me to go and fetch

1051
01:00:42,213 --> 01:00:43,703
your precious Christopher to help?

1052
01:00:49,821 --> 01:00:51,050
I'm sorry.

1053
01:00:51,222 --> 01:00:53,156
Mm...

1054
01:00:58,062 --> 01:01:01,157
I want you... I want you to stay because I-l like you.

1055
01:01:01,332 --> 01:01:04,597
I like...talking to you.

1056
01:01:04,769 --> 01:01:07,101
I like talking to you,too, Alan.

1057
01:01:12,443 --> 01:01:14,810
And what if you weren't alone?

1058
01:01:14,979 --> 01:01:16,913
What if you had a husband?

1059
01:01:18,616 --> 01:01:20,584
Do you have one in mind?

1060
01:01:20,752 --> 01:01:22,117
I do.

1061
01:01:22,286 --> 01:01:23,913
Hugh?

1062
01:01:24,088 --> 01:01:26,022
Hugh's terribly attractive,I'll give you that,

1063
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:28,318
but I don't really think he's the marrying kind.

1064
01:01:28,493 --> 01:01:31,485
No, I-l wasn't thinking of Hugh.

1065
01:01:31,663 --> 01:01:33,188
Or Peter.

1066
01:01:33,364 --> 01:01:35,458
Peter's so quiet.

1067
01:01:39,937 --> 01:01:41,837
Oh, my God.

1068
01:01:42,006 --> 01:01:43,303
But this makes sense.

1069
01:01:43,474 --> 01:01:44,942
Did you just propose to me?

1070
01:01:45,109 --> 01:01:47,737
Well, it is the logical thing to do.

1071
01:01:47,945 --> 01:01:50,209
- This is ridiculous.
-This is your parents.

1072
01:01:50,381 --> 01:01:53,840
I-I can't... believe that this is happening.

1073
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:57,882
Mm. Joan...

1074
01:01:59,557 --> 01:02:01,889
Is your middle name Caroline or Catherine?

1075
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:05,052
- Elizabeth.
-Um, Joan Elizabeth...

1076
01:02:05,229 --> 01:02:07,027
Clarke, um...

1077
01:02:09,233 --> 01:02:12,168
...will you marry me?

1078
01:02:20,678 --> 01:02:22,476
It's beautiful.

1079
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:26,641
Well, I know it isn't ordinary, but...

1080
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:29,651
whoever loved ordinary?

1081
01:02:29,787 --> 01:02:30,811
She had it in both hands...

1082
01:02:32,156 --> 01:02:34,955
And she looked up at me with her doe eyes and said,

1083
01:02:35,159 --> 01:02:37,150
"Am I supposed to put that in my mouth?"

1084
01:02:37,328 --> 01:02:41,060
And I said, "Yes.You know, the French way."

1085
01:02:41,232 --> 01:02:42,927
So she pops it in,

1086
01:02:43,101 --> 01:02:44,762
clamps her lips around it,

1087
01:02:44,936 --> 01:02:47,871
and starts humming the bloody Marseillaise.

1088
01:02:51,709 --> 01:02:52,904
Come have a dance.

1089
01:02:53,077 --> 01:02:54,067
No, no,no, you can dance

1090
01:02:54,245 --> 01:02:55,235
with your fiance anytime you like.

1091
01:02:55,413 --> 01:02:56,710
Right now, this moment...

1092
01:02:56,881 --> 01:02:58,610
my turn.

1093
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:28,037
What's the matter?

1094
01:03:33,651 --> 01:03:35,415
Wh-What if...

1095
01:03:40,658 --> 01:03:43,423
Wh-What if I don't fancy being...

1096
01:03:43,594 --> 01:03:46,859
with Joan I-in that way?

1097
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:51,296
Because you're a homosexual?

1098
01:03:55,273 --> 01:03:57,469
I suspected.

1099
01:03:57,642 --> 01:03:58,939
Well, should-should I tell her

1100
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:00,635
that I've had...

1101
01:04:00,812 --> 01:04:02,576
affairs with men?

1102
01:04:02,747 --> 01:04:04,579
You know, in my...

1103
01:04:04,749 --> 01:04:07,582
admittedly limited experience,

1104
01:04:07,752 --> 01:04:10,016
women... tend to be a bit touchy

1105
01:04:10,188 --> 01:04:13,180
about accidentally marrying homosexuals.

1106
01:04:13,357 --> 01:04:15,519
Perhaps not spreading this information about might be

1107
01:04:15,693 --> 01:04:16,956
in your best interest.

1108
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:20,520
I care for her,

1109
01:04:20,698 --> 01:04:22,689
I truly do. I...

1110
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:27,829
I-I... I just don't know

1111
01:04:28,005 --> 01:04:31,270
if I can, um... pretend.

1112
01:04:31,442 --> 01:04:33,877
You can't tell anyone, Alan.

1113
01:04:34,045 --> 01:04:36,139
It's illegal.

1114
01:04:36,314 --> 01:04:39,011
And Denniston is looking for any excuse he can

1115
01:04:39,183 --> 01:04:40,548
to put you away.

1116
01:04:40,718 --> 01:04:42,015
I know.

1117
01:04:42,186 --> 01:04:43,779
This has to stay a secret.

1118
01:04:43,955 --> 01:04:45,980
Come on, it's your turn.

1119
01:04:46,157 --> 01:04:47,955
Ah. Okay.

1120
01:06:09,874 --> 01:06:11,205
Cup of tea?

1121
01:06:11,375 --> 01:06:14,242
No, thank you.

1122
01:06:26,557 --> 01:06:29,219
Mr. Turing, can I tell you a secret?

1123
01:06:29,393 --> 01:06:30,952
I'm quite good with those.

1124
01:06:31,128 --> 01:06:33,119
I'm here to help you.

1125
01:06:35,633 --> 01:06:37,294
Oh, clearly.

1126
01:06:44,275 --> 01:06:46,141
Can machines think?

1127
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:49,405
Oh, so you've read some of my published works?

1128
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:51,606
What makes you say that?

1129
01:06:51,782 --> 01:06:54,308
Well, because I'm sitting in a police station,

1130
01:06:54,485 --> 01:06:57,614
accused of entreating a young man to touch my penis

1131
01:06:57,788 --> 01:07:01,281
and you just asked me if machines can think.

1132
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:04,453
Well, can they?

1133
01:07:05,997 --> 01:07:09,695
Could machines ever think as human beings do?

1134
01:07:10,468 --> 01:07:12,300
Most people say not.

1135
01:07:12,470 --> 01:07:14,837
You're not most people.

1136
01:07:16,941 --> 01:07:20,275
Well, the problem is you're...asking a stupid question.

1137
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:22,175
I am?

1138
01:07:22,346 --> 01:07:24,144
Of course machines...

1139
01:07:24,315 --> 01:07:27,717
can't think as people do.

1140
01:07:27,885 --> 01:07:31,549
A machine is different...from a person.

1141
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:35,118
Hence, they think differently.

1142
01:07:38,729 --> 01:07:41,824
The interesting question is,just because something, uh,

1143
01:07:41,999 --> 01:07:43,398
thinks differently from you,

1144
01:07:43,567 --> 01:07:46,332
does that mean it's not thinking?

1145
01:07:48,072 --> 01:07:51,007
Well, we allow for humans to have such divergences

1146
01:07:51,175 --> 01:07:52,643
from one another.

1147
01:07:55,846 --> 01:07:58,076
You like strawberries,I hate ice-skating,

1148
01:07:58,249 --> 01:08:00,911
you... cry at sad films,

1149
01:08:01,085 --> 01:08:04,817
I... am allergic to pollen.

1150
01:08:04,989 --> 01:08:07,515
What is the point of-of different tastes,

1151
01:08:07,691 --> 01:08:09,989
different... preferences

1152
01:08:10,161 --> 01:08:12,994
if not to say that our brains work differently,

1153
01:08:13,164 --> 01:08:15,690
that we think differently?

1154
01:08:17,101 --> 01:08:18,830
And if we can say that about one another,

1155
01:08:19,003 --> 01:08:21,700
then why can't we say the same thing for brains...

1156
01:08:22,706 --> 01:08:25,732
built of copper and wire, steel?

1157
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:27,878
And that's...

1158
01:08:28,045 --> 01:08:29,945
this big paper you wrote?

1159
01:08:30,114 --> 01:08:31,513
What's it called?

1160
01:08:31,682 --> 01:08:34,413
"The Imitation Game."

1161
01:08:34,585 --> 01:08:35,575
Right, that's...

1162
01:08:35,753 --> 01:08:36,743
that's what it's about?

1163
01:08:42,626 --> 01:08:43,855
Would you like to play?

1164
01:08:44,028 --> 01:08:45,655
Play?

1165
01:08:45,863 --> 01:08:47,058
It's a game.

1166
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:49,427
A test of sorts.

1167
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,592
For determining whether something is a...

1168
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:54,829
a machine or a human being.

1169
01:08:55,039 --> 01:08:56,803
How do I play?

1170
01:08:56,974 --> 01:08:58,965
Well, there's a judge and a subject, and...

1171
01:08:59,143 --> 01:09:01,544
the judge asks questions,

1172
01:09:01,712 --> 01:09:03,771
and, depending on the subject's answers,

1173
01:09:03,948 --> 01:09:06,280
determines who he is talking with...

1174
01:09:06,450 --> 01:09:11,081
what he is talking with,and, um...

1175
01:09:11,255 --> 01:09:13,986
All you have to do is ask me a question.

1176
01:09:19,497 --> 01:09:21,124
What did you do during the war?

1177
01:09:21,298 --> 01:09:23,494
I worked in a radio factory.

1178
01:09:25,769 --> 01:09:27,760
What did you really do during the war?

1179
01:09:32,143 --> 01:09:34,237
Are you paying attention?

1180
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:55,089
Damn it!

1181
01:10:02,273 --> 01:10:05,470
We're soon out of time. A month.

1182
01:10:05,643 --> 01:10:07,543
So that's it, then, is it?

1183
01:10:07,711 --> 01:10:10,180
Oh, the trouble is, it doesn't matter how much we improve it.

1184
01:10:10,347 --> 01:10:11,940
The machine's never gonna be able to process

1185
01:10:12,116 --> 01:10:14,676
159 million million million possibilities in time.

1186
01:10:14,852 --> 01:10:16,980
It's just bloody hopeless.

1187
01:10:17,154 --> 01:10:19,486
It's searching.It's just...

1188
01:10:19,657 --> 01:10:23,093
It... doesn't know what it's searching for.

1189
01:10:23,294 --> 01:10:25,194
If we knew what the messages were going to say...

1190
01:10:25,362 --> 01:10:26,523
If we knew what the messages were going to say,

1191
01:10:26,697 --> 01:10:28,392
we wouldn't have to decrypt them at all.

1192
01:10:33,437 --> 01:10:35,405
Who's Alan's friend?

1193
01:10:35,573 --> 01:10:38,304
Hugh. He's a bit of a cad, actually.

1194
01:10:38,475 --> 01:10:40,466
So my type, then?

1195
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:42,545
- Well, I'll introduce you.
-No.

1196
01:10:42,713 --> 01:10:44,807
He'll come over.

1197
01:10:44,982 --> 01:10:46,643
- Are you sure?
-Yes.

1198
01:10:46,784 --> 01:10:48,377
I smiled at him 15 minutes ago

1199
01:10:48,552 --> 01:10:49,644
and haven't looked back since.

1200
01:10:52,356 --> 01:10:53,414
Who's that with Joan?

1201
01:10:53,591 --> 01:10:54,956
Hmm?

1202
01:10:55,159 --> 01:10:57,389
Uh, Helen. Works with her.

1203
01:10:57,561 --> 01:10:59,051
She's really pretty.

1204
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:00,698
She wants me to come over.

1205
01:11:00,864 --> 01:11:03,231
What? H-How on earth can you know that?

1206
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,232
She smiled at me a while back

1207
01:11:05,402 --> 01:11:07,234
and she hasn't looked again since.

1208
01:11:12,543 --> 01:11:13,772
And got him.

1209
01:11:13,944 --> 01:11:16,379
Now, why is this,that when I was single

1210
01:11:16,547 --> 01:11:18,709
I found it very boring,but now that I'm engaged,

1211
01:11:18,882 --> 01:11:20,350
I just find it dreadfully fun.

1212
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:24,449
Bingo. She's in.

1213
01:11:24,622 --> 01:11:26,386
Alan, introduce us.

1214
01:11:26,557 --> 01:11:28,582
What? Wh-Why me?

1215
01:11:30,561 --> 01:11:32,290
Because there's nothing like a friend's engagement

1216
01:11:32,463 --> 01:11:34,261
to make a woman want to do something she'll later regret

1217
01:11:34,431 --> 01:11:36,422
with the fiance's better looking chum.

1218
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,965
Let's go.

1219
01:11:42,906 --> 01:11:45,898
Half a crown says Alan bollixes this up entirely.

1220
01:11:46,076 --> 01:11:47,544
No bet.

1221
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:50,078
- Alan Turing has a theory.
-He has many.

1222
01:11:50,247 --> 01:11:52,045
He believes that the regulations

1223
01:11:52,216 --> 01:11:55,277
against men and women working side by side are sound

1224
01:11:55,452 --> 01:11:57,318
because such proximity will necessarily lead to romance.

1225
01:11:57,488 --> 01:11:58,751
What? No,I don't. I...

1226
01:11:58,922 --> 01:12:00,083
However...

1227
01:12:00,257 --> 01:12:01,247
I disagree.

1228
01:12:01,425 --> 01:12:02,950
- You do?
-Yeah.

1229
01:12:03,127 --> 01:12:05,323
I think that if I were working beside a woman all daylong,

1230
01:12:05,496 --> 01:12:08,158
I could appreciate her abilities and intellect

1231
01:12:08,332 --> 01:12:10,562
without taking her to bed.

1232
01:12:11,602 --> 01:12:12,831
I'm sorry, have we met?

1233
01:12:13,003 --> 01:12:15,631
I don't recall.But let's assume we haven't.

1234
01:12:15,806 --> 01:12:17,433
Helen Stewart.Hugh Alexander.

1235
01:12:17,608 --> 01:12:18,666
So who do you agree with,

1236
01:12:18,842 --> 01:12:21,004
- Alan or myself?
-Well, Alan, of course.

1237
01:12:21,178 --> 01:12:24,148
L-I'm very flattered, really,but I-l don't think...

1238
01:12:24,315 --> 01:12:27,114
- Rubbish.
-Well, I work beside a man

1239
01:12:27,284 --> 01:12:28,809
every day,and I can't help

1240
01:12:28,986 --> 01:12:30,511
but have developed a bit of a crush on him.

1241
01:12:30,688 --> 01:12:32,452
Well, who is this man?So I can kick his arse.

1242
01:12:32,623 --> 01:12:34,682
Well, there's no need to worry... it's been chaste.

1243
01:12:34,858 --> 01:12:37,350
We've never even met.He's a German.

1244
01:12:37,528 --> 01:12:40,691
Now I really want to kill him.

1245
01:12:40,864 --> 01:12:44,129
How-how do you mean you work alongside a German?

1246
01:12:44,301 --> 01:12:45,962
Well, each of us intercepts messages

1247
01:12:46,136 --> 01:12:47,865
from a specific German radio tower.

1248
01:12:48,038 --> 01:12:49,301
So we have a counterpart on the other side

1249
01:12:49,473 --> 01:12:50,838
who's tip-tapping out the messages.

1250
01:12:51,008 --> 01:12:52,772
Everyone types a touch differently,

1251
01:12:52,943 --> 01:12:54,775
so you get to know the rhythm of your counterpart.

1252
01:12:54,945 --> 01:12:56,674
It's strangely intimate.

1253
01:12:56,847 --> 01:12:58,838
I feel as if I know him so well.

1254
01:12:59,016 --> 01:13:00,347
It's a pity he has a girlfriend,

1255
01:13:00,517 --> 01:13:02,781
but that's why I disagree with you, Mr. Alexander.

1256
01:13:02,953 --> 01:13:04,887
Because I'm in love with a coworker of sorts,

1257
01:13:05,055 --> 01:13:06,545
and we've never even met.

1258
01:13:06,724 --> 01:13:08,351
Well, allow me to buy you another pint,

1259
01:13:08,525 --> 01:13:10,118
and I'll tell you why you're wrong.

1260
01:13:10,294 --> 01:13:11,693
Let's.

1261
01:13:11,862 --> 01:13:13,193
Excellent.

1262
01:13:15,799 --> 01:13:17,699
Thanks.

1263
01:13:17,868 --> 01:13:21,566
Um, pints.Have you got any sloe gin?

1264
01:13:24,708 --> 01:13:26,904
In case you were wondering,that's what flirting looks like.

1265
01:13:27,077 --> 01:13:28,545
Helen...

1266
01:13:28,712 --> 01:13:30,646
- Really, no cigarettes?
-Alan...

1267
01:13:30,814 --> 01:13:32,009
Yes, Alan?

1268
01:13:32,182 --> 01:13:33,581
Wh-Why do you think

1269
01:13:33,751 --> 01:13:36,118
your German counterpart has a girlfriend?

1270
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:39,221
- It's just a stupid joke; don't worry.
-No, no, no, no. Tell me.

1271
01:13:40,424 --> 01:13:41,550
Well, each of his messages

1272
01:13:41,725 --> 01:13:43,022
begins with the same five letters:

1273
01:13:43,193 --> 01:13:45,025
C-I-L-L-Y
C-I-L-L-Y.

1274
01:13:45,195 --> 01:13:46,890
So I suspect that Cilly must be the name

1275
01:13:47,064 --> 01:13:48,554
- of his amore.
-But that's impossible.

1276
01:13:48,732 --> 01:13:50,757
The Germans are instructed to use five random letters

1277
01:13:50,934 --> 01:13:52,026
at the start of every message.

1278
01:13:52,202 --> 01:13:53,567
Well, this bloke doesn't.

1279
01:13:53,737 --> 01:13:57,002
Love will make a man do strange things, I suppose.

1280
01:13:57,174 --> 01:14:00,508
In this case, love just lost Germany the whole bloody war.

1281
01:14:00,677 --> 01:14:01,872
Oh!

1282
01:14:02,045 --> 01:14:03,171
Go, Peter.

1283
01:14:04,915 --> 01:14:06,246
Sorry.

1284
01:14:08,218 --> 01:14:11,677
Alan! Alan!

1285
01:14:11,855 --> 01:14:14,085
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!Hey, hey, hey!

1286
01:14:14,258 --> 01:14:15,248
Alan!

1287
01:14:15,426 --> 01:14:17,690
I just want...

1288
01:14:20,063 --> 01:14:21,758
Hugh Alexander.John Cairncross.

1289
01:14:21,932 --> 01:14:23,229
Peter bloody Hilton.

1290
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:27,030

1291
01:14:28,939 --> 01:14:30,771
What...

1292
01:14:30,941 --> 01:14:33,433
what if...what if Christopher

1293
01:14:33,610 --> 01:14:36,807
doesn't have to search through all of the settings?

1294
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:38,744
What if he only has to search through

1295
01:14:38,916 --> 01:14:41,715
ones that produce words we already know will be

1296
01:14:41,852 --> 01:14:44,082
- in the message?
-Repeated words; predictable words.

1297
01:14:44,254 --> 01:14:45,244
Exactly.

1298
01:14:48,125 --> 01:14:49,251
Look, look, like this one.

1299
01:14:49,426 --> 01:14:51,258
"0600 hours. Weather today is clear.

1300
01:14:51,428 --> 01:14:53,260
Rain in the evening. Heil Hitler."

1301
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:56,963
Well, that's it.

1302
01:14:57,134 --> 01:14:58,624
Exactly.

1303
01:14:58,802 --> 01:15:01,669
They send a weather report every day at 6:00 a.m.

1304
01:15:01,839 --> 01:15:05,104
So that's-that's three words we know will be

1305
01:15:05,275 --> 01:15:07,972
in every 6:00 a.m. message..."weather," obviously,

1306
01:15:08,145 --> 01:15:10,136
- a-and...
-Heil bloody Hitler.

1307
01:15:10,314 --> 01:15:12,146
Heil bloody Hitler.

1308
01:15:12,316 --> 01:15:14,683
Here's the 6:00 message from this morning.

1309
01:15:21,191 --> 01:15:22,784
Hugh, the, uh,

1310
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,587
the right-hand letter wheel,set them to...

1311
01:15:24,761 --> 01:15:26,320
I know, I know."Weather" and "Hitler."

1312
01:15:26,497 --> 01:15:28,932
Peter, John, run voltages through those letters,

1313
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:31,433
- through the back scramblers.
-So we'll use the loops?

1314
01:15:31,602 --> 01:15:33,934
Yes. Joan, what was the last 6:00 a.m. message?

1315
01:15:34,104 --> 01:15:35,162

Done.

1322
01:16:05,536 --> 01:16:07,026
Come on.

1323
01:16:07,204 --> 01:16:09,468
Come on.Come on, Christopher.

1324
01:16:24,721 --> 01:16:26,246
Oh, my God.

1325
01:16:33,230 --> 01:16:34,755
Wh-What happened?

1326
01:16:36,366 --> 01:16:38,528
- Did it work?
-Alan?

1327
01:16:38,702 --> 01:16:40,534
Alan! Alan!

1328
01:16:43,073 --> 01:16:45,041
I need a new message.

1329
01:16:45,208 --> 01:16:47,233
The latest intercept.

1330
01:16:50,747 --> 01:16:52,977

"is directed to 53 degrees 24 minutes north

1347
01:17:32,456 --> 01:17:34,948
Heil Hitler.

1348
01:17:38,095 --> 01:17:41,121
Turns out that's the only German you need to know

1349
01:17:41,298 --> 01:17:43,630
to, uh, break Enigma.

1350
01:17:50,907 --> 01:17:52,932
Yes!

1351
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:36,509

My God, you did it.

1364
01:19:15,092 --> 01:19:19,086
You just defeated Nazism with a crossword puzzle.

1365
01:19:19,262 --> 01:19:20,855
There are five people in the world who know

1366
01:19:21,031 --> 01:19:22,192
the position of every ship in the Atlantic.

1367
01:19:22,365 --> 01:19:23,730
They're all

1368
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:25,561
- in this room.
-Oh, good God.

1369
01:19:25,736 --> 01:19:27,226
Oh, I don't think even He has the power

1370
01:19:27,404 --> 01:19:28,565
- that we do right now. -No.

1371
01:19:28,739 --> 01:19:30,138
There's going to be an attack

1372
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:31,706
on a British passenger convoy.

1373
01:19:31,875 --> 01:19:33,104
Right there.

1374
01:19:33,276 --> 01:19:35,472
God, you're right. All those U-boats are only

1375
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:37,169
- 20, 3O minutes away.
-Civilians.

1376
01:19:37,314 --> 01:19:38,941
Hundreds of them. We can save their lives.

1377
01:19:39,116 --> 01:19:40,606
I'll phone Denniston's office so that

1378
01:19:40,784 --> 01:19:41,910
- he can alert the Admiralty.
-Do you think

1379
01:19:42,085 --> 01:19:43,075
there's enough time to save them?

1380
01:19:43,253 --> 01:19:44,345
There should be,if we can get...

1381
01:19:44,488 --> 01:19:46,582
Commander Denniston's office,please. It's urgent.

1382
01:19:46,757 --> 01:19:47,747
No.

1383
01:19:47,924 --> 01:19:49,187
What the hell are you doing?

1384
01:19:49,359 --> 01:19:51,191
You-you can't call Denniston.

1385
01:19:51,361 --> 01:19:53,261
You-you can't tell him about the attack.

1386
01:19:53,430 --> 01:19:55,125
- What are you talking about?
-We can have

1387
01:19:55,298 --> 01:19:56,629
air support over that convoy in ten minutes.

1388
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:57,926
Let the U-boats...

1389
01:19:58,101 --> 01:19:59,159
- sink the convoy.
-Look, it's been

1390
01:19:59,369 --> 01:20:00,393
a big day...maybe you're...

1391
01:20:00,570 --> 01:20:04,006
- We don't have time...
-No!

1392
01:20:04,174 --> 01:20:05,733
Oh! Hugh! Hugh!That's enough!

1393
01:20:05,909 --> 01:20:07,172
- That's enough!
-Stop, Hugh!

1394
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:08,641
John, the attack is in minutes.

1395
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:11,944
Yes, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.

1396
01:20:12,115 --> 01:20:14,607
I'm fine.

1397
01:20:14,785 --> 01:20:18,517
You know why people like violence, Hugh?

1398
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:21,453
It's because it feels good.

1399
01:20:21,625 --> 01:20:25,084
Sometimes we can't do what feels good.

1400
01:20:25,262 --> 01:20:26,923
We have to do what is logical.

1401
01:20:27,164 --> 01:20:28,757
What's logical?

1402
01:20:28,932 --> 01:20:30,331
Hardest time to lie to somebody

1403
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:32,332
is when they're expecting to be lied to.

1404
01:20:32,502 --> 01:20:33,936
Oh, God.

1405
01:20:34,104 --> 01:20:35,401
What?

1406
01:20:35,572 --> 01:20:36,835
If someone's waiting for a lie,

1407
01:20:37,007 --> 01:20:38,497
you can't just,uh, give them one.

1408
01:20:40,310 --> 01:20:41,800
Damn it, Alan's right.

1409
01:20:41,978 --> 01:20:43,776
What?

1410
01:20:43,947 --> 01:20:46,439
What would the Germans think if we destroy

1411
01:20:46,616 --> 01:20:48,175
their U-boats?

1412
01:20:48,351 --> 01:20:49,944
Nothing. They'll be dead.

1413
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:51,451
No.

1414
01:20:51,621 --> 01:20:53,453
No, you can't be right.

1415
01:20:53,623 --> 01:20:54,613
So our convoy

1416
01:20:54,791 --> 01:20:57,351
suddenly veers off course...

1417
01:20:57,527 --> 01:20:59,621
a squadron of our air bombers

1418
01:20:59,796 --> 01:21:03,357
miraculously descends on the coordinates of the U-boats...

1419
01:21:03,533 --> 01:21:07,333
what will the Germans think?

1420
01:21:08,338 --> 01:21:10,432
The Germans will know

1421
01:21:10,607 --> 01:21:12,701
that we have broken Enigma.

1422
01:21:12,876 --> 01:21:16,835
They'll stop all radio communications by midday,

1423
01:21:17,013 --> 01:21:18,538
and they'll have changed the design of Enigma

1424
01:21:18,715 --> 01:21:21,650
- by the weekend.
-Yes.

1425
01:21:21,818 --> 01:21:23,718
Two years' work.

1426
01:21:23,887 --> 01:21:26,015
Everything that we've done here

1427
01:21:26,189 --> 01:21:28,248
will all be for nothing.

1428
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:30,553
There are 500 civilians in that convoy.

1429
01:21:30,727 --> 01:21:31,888
Women...

1430
01:21:32,062 --> 01:21:34,554
children.

1431
01:21:34,731 --> 01:21:36,859
We're about to let them die.

1432
01:21:37,033 --> 01:21:38,501
Our job I-is

1433
01:21:38,668 --> 01:21:41,296
not to save one passenger convoy, it is to win

1434
01:21:41,471 --> 01:21:44,907
- the war.
-Our job was to crack Enigma.

1435
01:21:45,075 --> 01:21:46,941
We've done that.

1436
01:21:47,143 --> 01:21:49,237
Now for the hard part.

1437
01:21:50,747 --> 01:21:53,011
- Keeping it a secret.
-Carlisle.

1438
01:21:53,183 --> 01:21:55,743
What?

1439
01:21:55,919 --> 01:21:58,047
The convoy you're about to...it's, uh...

1440
01:21:58,221 --> 01:22:01,247
The HMS Carlisle is one of the ships.

1441
01:22:02,859 --> 01:22:05,123
We can't act on every piece of intelligence.

1442
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:07,161
So fine, we won't.

1443
01:22:07,297 --> 01:22:08,992
Just this one.

1444
01:22:09,165 --> 01:22:11,827
Peter, what's the matter with you?

1445
01:22:12,002 --> 01:22:14,471
My-my brother's...

1446
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:17,005
well, he's on the Carlisle.

1447
01:22:18,708 --> 01:22:21,336
A gunnery ensign.

1448
01:22:23,546 --> 01:22:26,607
I'm...

1449
01:22:26,783 --> 01:22:29,047
I'm so sorry.

1450
01:22:31,354 --> 01:22:33,948
Who the hell do you think you are?

1451
01:22:34,124 --> 01:22:36,092
This... this is my brother.

1452
01:22:38,728 --> 01:22:40,253
He's my big brother,all right, and you have

1453
01:22:40,430 --> 01:22:41,761
a few minutes to call off his murder.

1454
01:22:41,932 --> 01:22:43,866
We can't.

1455
01:22:46,303 --> 01:22:48,738
He's right.

1456
01:22:48,905 --> 01:22:50,805
Alan.

1457
01:22:50,974 --> 01:22:54,239
Joan.

1458
01:22:54,411 --> 01:22:55,879
Hugh.

1459
01:22:56,046 --> 01:22:58,378
John.

1460
01:22:58,515 --> 01:23:00,916
Please, I...

1461
01:23:01,084 --> 01:23:02,609
The-the Germans, they won't get suspicious

1462
01:23:02,786 --> 01:23:04,413
just because we stop one attack.

1463
01:23:04,587 --> 01:23:06,851
No one will know.

1464
01:23:07,023 --> 01:23:08,855
I'm asking you...

1465
01:23:09,025 --> 01:23:11,289
as your friend.

1466
01:23:11,461 --> 01:23:12,986
Please.

1467
01:23:16,032 --> 01:23:17,966
I'm so sorry.

1468
01:23:18,134 --> 01:23:21,001
You're not God, Alan...you don't get to decide

1469
01:23:21,171 --> 01:23:23,162
who lives and who dies.

1470
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:25,672
Yes, we do.

1471
01:23:27,911 --> 01:23:29,538
Why?

1472
01:23:29,746 --> 01:23:33,182
Because no one else can.

1473
01:24:19,596 --> 01:24:21,724
Why are you telling me this?

1474
01:24:21,898 --> 01:24:25,630
We need your help to keep this a secret from...

1475
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:29,569
Admiralty, Army, RAF.

1476
01:24:29,739 --> 01:24:33,004
Uh, no one can know we broke Enigma.

1477
01:24:33,176 --> 01:24:35,076
Not even Denniston.

1478
01:24:35,245 --> 01:24:37,839
Who's in the process of having you fired.

1479
01:24:38,014 --> 01:24:39,812
You can take care of that.

1480
01:24:39,983 --> 01:24:42,543
While we develop a system to help you determine

1481
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:44,244
how much intelligence

1482
01:24:44,421 --> 01:24:46,856
to act on... which a-attacks to stop,

1483
01:24:47,023 --> 01:24:48,013
which to let through.

1484
01:24:48,191 --> 01:24:50,592
Statistical analysis.

1485
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:52,387
The minimal number of actions

1486
01:24:52,562 --> 01:24:55,054
it would take for us to win the war...

1487
01:24:55,231 --> 01:24:57,598
but the maximum number we can take

1488
01:24:57,767 --> 01:25:00,099
before the Germans get suspicious.

1489
01:25:00,270 --> 01:25:04,366
And you're going to trust all this to statistics?

1490
01:25:04,541 --> 01:25:06,976
- To maths?
-Correct.

1491
01:25:07,143 --> 01:25:09,077
And then MI6 can come up with the lies

1492
01:25:09,245 --> 01:25:10,713
that we tell everybody else.

1493
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:14,214
You'll need a believable alternative source for all

1494
01:25:14,384 --> 01:25:15,874
the pieces of information you use.

1495
01:25:16,052 --> 01:25:18,885
A false story so that we can explain how we got our information

1496
01:25:19,055 --> 01:25:20,682
that has nothing to do with Enigma.

1497
01:25:20,857 --> 01:25:23,952
And then you can leak those stories to the, uh, the Germans.

1498
01:25:24,127 --> 01:25:26,095
And then to our own military.

1499
01:25:31,267 --> 01:25:33,395
Maintain a conspiracy of lies

1500
01:25:33,570 --> 01:25:36,039
at the highest levels of government.

1501
01:25:43,947 --> 01:25:46,780
Sounds right up my alley.

1502
01:25:49,986 --> 01:25:52,785
Alan, I so rarely have cause to say this,

1503
01:25:52,956 --> 01:25:56,915
but you are exactly the man I always hoped you would be.

1504
01:26:10,306 --> 01:26:13,742
They code-named it "Ultra."

1505
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:16,777
It became the largest store of military intelligence

1506
01:26:16,946 --> 01:26:19,916
in, uh...the history of the world.

1507
01:26:26,990 --> 01:26:30,927
It was like having a tap on Himmler's intercom.

1508
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:33,119
I-E-O...
I-E-O...

1509
01:26:34,931 --> 01:26:37,229
Secrecy became the primary concern,

1510
01:26:37,433 --> 01:26:40,994
and for some reason, they...they trusted me.

1511
01:26:42,305 --> 01:26:44,672
Peter... do you have the, uh,

1512
01:26:44,841 --> 01:26:46,809
the-the 630 decryp...

1513
01:27:25,415 --> 01:27:27,179
...it's a Beale cipher

1514
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:28,977
encrypted with a phrase from a book or...

1515
01:27:29,152 --> 01:27:31,348
"Ask,and it will be given to you;

1516
01:27:31,521 --> 01:27:33,649
seek and you will find."Matthew 7:7.

1517
01:27:33,823 --> 01:27:35,985
That was the key.

1518
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:38,719
Peter will come around eventually.

1519
01:27:46,536 --> 01:27:48,766
Jack.

1520
01:27:48,938 --> 01:27:52,602
Could you give Alan and me a moment, please?

1521
01:28:02,785 --> 01:28:04,116
The Soviets and us,

1522
01:28:04,287 --> 01:28:06,221
we're on the same side.

1523
01:28:06,389 --> 01:28:09,222
What I'm doing will help Britain.

1524
01:28:09,392 --> 01:28:12,054
L-I have to tell Denniston.

1525
01:28:12,228 --> 01:28:15,254
No, you don't.

1526
01:28:15,431 --> 01:28:17,525
Because if you tell him my secret...

1527
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:19,964
I'll tell him yours.

1528
01:28:21,738 --> 01:28:25,140
Do you know what they do to homosexuals?

1529
01:28:25,308 --> 01:28:27,140
You'll never be able to work again,

1530
01:28:27,310 --> 01:28:29,176
never be able to teach.

1531
01:28:29,379 --> 01:28:31,313
Your precious machine...

1532
01:28:31,481 --> 01:28:33,916
I doubt you'll ever see him again.

1533
01:28:49,932 --> 01:28:51,923
Hello. Can I... can I, um,

1534
01:28:52,101 --> 01:28:54,229
speak to Stewart Menzies, please? It's urgent.

1535
01:28:54,404 --> 01:28:56,498
One moment, please.

1536
01:28:59,642 --> 01:29:01,610
Hello. Menzies.

1537
01:29:04,414 --> 01:29:07,076
Some advice about keeping secrets.

1538
01:29:10,119 --> 01:29:14,283
It's a lot easier if you don't know them in the first place.

1539
01:29:14,457 --> 01:29:18,018
Were they steaming my letters,tapping my telephone?

1540
01:29:19,462 --> 01:29:22,193
Trailing my nervous walks?

1541
01:29:22,365 --> 01:29:24,993
You know, I...

1542
01:29:25,168 --> 01:29:27,136
I never did find out.

1543
01:29:27,303 --> 01:29:29,362
Joan?

1544
01:29:32,675 --> 01:29:34,109
Joan?

1545
01:29:34,277 --> 01:29:36,041
What's...

1546
01:29:38,114 --> 01:29:39,445
Uh...

1547
01:29:39,615 --> 01:29:41,310
where's Joan?

1548
01:29:41,484 --> 01:29:43,612
Military prison.

1549
01:29:45,355 --> 01:29:47,153
What have you done?

1550
01:29:47,323 --> 01:29:50,190
Decoded Enigma intercepts.I found a pile of them

1551
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:53,887
- in the bedside table.
-No, no. I-l gave those to her

1552
01:29:54,063 --> 01:29:56,327
over a year ago when I was trying to figure out

1553
01:29:56,499 --> 01:29:58,661
- a link between...
-I'm sure you did.

1554
01:29:58,835 --> 01:30:00,633
Denniston's been looking for a Soviet spy.

1555
01:30:00,803 --> 01:30:03,295
He's been looking inside Hut 8.

1556
01:30:04,374 --> 01:30:05,842
I know who the spy is.

1557
01:30:07,510 --> 01:30:10,343
It's not Joan.It's...

1558
01:30:10,513 --> 01:30:12,743
it's Cairncross.

1559
01:30:12,915 --> 01:30:15,179
L-I found the Beale cipher,

1560
01:30:15,351 --> 01:30:17,183
the Bible.

1561
01:30:17,353 --> 01:30:20,323
God, I wish you'd been a spy.

1562
01:30:20,490 --> 01:30:23,357
You'd be so much better at this than he is.

1563
01:30:24,865 --> 01:30:25,899
You knew it was him?

1564
01:30:26,329 --> 01:30:28,354
Of course I bloody knew.

1565
01:30:28,531 --> 01:30:30,590
I knew before he came to Bletchley.

1566
01:30:30,767 --> 01:30:33,361
Why do you think I had him placed here?

1567
01:30:33,536 --> 01:30:36,062
But we have an Enigma machine.

1568
01:30:36,239 --> 01:30:37,729
Yeah, Polish Intelligence...

1569
01:30:37,907 --> 01:30:39,102
You-you placed

1570
01:30:39,275 --> 01:30:43,837
a... a Soviet agent at Bletchley Park?

1571
01:30:44,013 --> 01:30:45,344
It's really quite useful to be able

1572
01:30:45,515 --> 01:30:47,108
to leak whatever we want to Stalin.

1573
01:30:47,283 --> 01:30:50,116
Churchill's too damn paranoid.

1574
01:30:50,286 --> 01:30:52,380
He won't share a shred of intelligence

1575
01:30:52,555 --> 01:30:54,683
with the Soviets.

1576
01:30:54,857 --> 01:30:57,588
Not even information that will help them against the Germans.

1577
01:30:57,760 --> 01:30:59,228
There's...

1578
01:30:59,395 --> 01:31:01,022
so much secrecy.

1579
01:31:02,532 --> 01:31:05,524
Cairncross has no idea we know, of course.

1580
01:31:05,701 --> 01:31:09,103
He's really not the brightest bulb.

1581
01:31:09,272 --> 01:31:10,706
Which is why I need your help.

1582
01:31:10,873 --> 01:31:12,898
I want to know what to leak to John,

1583
01:31:13,075 --> 01:31:14,236
what to feed to the Soviets,

1584
01:31:14,410 --> 01:31:16,276
as well as the British.

1585
01:31:16,446 --> 01:31:19,746
I... I'm not a spy.

1586
01:31:19,916 --> 01:31:23,079
I'm... I'm just a mathematician.

1587
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:27,053
I know a lot of spies, Alan.

1588
01:31:27,223 --> 01:31:30,454
You've got more secrets than the best of them.

1589
01:31:34,831 --> 01:31:38,426
You... you have to promise me that you will release Joan.

1590
01:31:38,427 --> 01:31:40,727
Yes, John's at the market

1591
01:31:40,603 --> 01:31:43,129
She's gonna be back in an hour. I lied.

1592
01:31:44,207 --> 01:31:47,074
I better hold on to these.

1593
01:31:47,243 --> 01:31:48,677
If anybody finds out about them,

1594
01:31:48,845 --> 01:31:51,610
prison will be the least of her worries.

1595
01:31:53,649 --> 01:31:55,674
Oh,Alan...

1596
01:31:55,852 --> 01:31:59,083
we're gonna have such a wonderful war together.

1597
01:32:17,473 --> 01:32:20,135
I need you to leave Bletchley.

1598
01:32:20,309 --> 01:32:22,937
- What?
-It's Menzies. I don't trust him.

1599
01:32:23,112 --> 01:32:26,446
-It's not safe here.
-Do you think it's any safer

1600
01:32:26,616 --> 01:32:27,947
- anywhere else?
-You need to get away.

1601
01:32:28,117 --> 01:32:29,642
You need to get very far away from me.

1602
01:32:29,819 --> 01:32:31,981
Alan, what's happened?

1603
01:32:34,991 --> 01:32:36,891
We can't be engaged anymore.

1604
01:32:37,059 --> 01:32:39,118
You... your parents need to take you back

1605
01:32:39,295 --> 01:32:41,559
and find you a husband elsewhere.

1606
01:32:42,665 --> 01:32:44,656
What's wrong with you?

1607
01:32:46,469 --> 01:32:49,336
I have something, uh, uh, to tell you.

1608
01:32:49,505 --> 01:32:51,473
I'm...

1609
01:32:54,010 --> 01:32:56,104
I'm a homosexual.

1610
01:32:58,481 --> 01:33:00,142
All right.

1611
01:33:00,316 --> 01:33:02,808
No, no. M-Men, Joan...

1612
01:33:02,985 --> 01:33:04,919
uh, not women.

1613
01:33:05,087 --> 01:33:07,146
- So what?
-Well,

1614
01:33:07,323 --> 01:33:08,347
I-I just told you.

1615
01:33:08,524 --> 01:33:10,458
So what?

1616
01:33:12,862 --> 01:33:15,388
I had my suspicions;I always did.

1617
01:33:15,565 --> 01:33:17,556
But we're not like other people.

1618
01:33:17,733 --> 01:33:19,701
We love each other in our own way,

1619
01:33:19,869 --> 01:33:22,270
and we can have the life together that we want.

1620
01:33:22,438 --> 01:33:24,998
You-you... you won't be the perfect husband.

1621
01:33:25,174 --> 01:33:26,539
Well,I can promise you,

1622
01:33:26,709 --> 01:33:28,973
I have no intention of being the perfect wife.

1623
01:33:29,178 --> 01:33:31,613
I'll not be... fixing your lamb all day

1624
01:33:31,781 --> 01:33:33,772
while you come home from the office.

1625
01:33:33,950 --> 01:33:35,611
I'll work.

1626
01:33:35,785 --> 01:33:37,719
You'll work.

1627
01:33:39,355 --> 01:33:42,120
And we'll have each other's company.

1628
01:33:42,291 --> 01:33:44,123
We'll have each other's minds.

1629
01:33:44,293 --> 01:33:47,228
That sounds like a better marriage than most.

1630
01:33:49,799 --> 01:33:52,791
Because I care for you.

1631
01:33:52,969 --> 01:33:56,735
And you care for me.

1632
01:33:56,906 --> 01:33:58,431
And we understand one another more than...

1633
01:33:58,608 --> 01:34:01,202
more than anyone else ever has.

1634
01:34:02,845 --> 01:34:04,574
I don't.

1635
01:34:07,083 --> 01:34:10,417
- What?
-Care for you.

1636
01:34:10,586 --> 01:34:12,076
I never did.

1637
01:34:12,254 --> 01:34:14,916
L-I just needed you to break Enigma.

1638
01:34:15,091 --> 01:34:18,186
I've done that now, so... so you can go.

1639
01:34:23,766 --> 01:34:25,996
I'm not going anywhere.

1640
01:34:26,168 --> 01:34:28,432
I've spent entirely too much of my life

1641
01:34:28,604 --> 01:34:30,504
worried about what you think of me,

1642
01:34:30,673 --> 01:34:32,141
or what my parents think of me,

1643
01:34:32,308 --> 01:34:34,743
or the boys in Hut 8 or the girls in Hut 3.

1644
01:34:34,910 --> 01:34:36,435
And do you know what? I'm done.

1645
01:34:36,612 --> 01:34:40,674
This is the most important work I will ever do,

1646
01:34:40,850 --> 01:34:43,148
and no one is going to stop me.

1647
01:34:43,319 --> 01:34:44,809
Least of all, you.

1648
01:34:47,356 --> 01:34:50,348
You know what, they were right.

1649
01:34:50,526 --> 01:34:53,461
Peter, Hugh, John.

1650
01:34:56,432 --> 01:34:58,628
You really are a monster.

1651
01:35:15,885 --> 01:35:19,219
The war dragged on for two more...

1652
01:35:19,388 --> 01:35:22,688
solitary years...

1653
01:35:22,858 --> 01:35:24,986
and every day we performed

1654
01:35:25,161 --> 01:35:28,791
our blood-soaked calculus.

1655
01:35:28,964 --> 01:35:33,333
Every day we decided who lived and who died.

1656
01:35:33,502 --> 01:35:34,799
Every day we...

1657
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:38,998
helped the Allies to victories,and nobody knew.

1658
01:35:42,144 --> 01:35:45,011
Stalingrad.

1659
01:35:45,181 --> 01:35:46,376
The Ardenne.

1660
01:35:46,549 --> 01:35:48,039
The invasion of Normandy.

1661
01:35:48,217 --> 01:35:50,845
All victories that would not have been possible

1662
01:35:51,020 --> 01:35:53,648
without the intelligence that we supplied.

1663
01:35:54,990 --> 01:35:56,651
And people...

1664
01:35:56,792 --> 01:36:00,820
talk about the war as this epic battle between, um...

1665
01:36:00,996 --> 01:36:03,363
civilizations...

1666
01:36:03,532 --> 01:36:05,364
freedom versus tyranny,

1667
01:36:05,534 --> 01:36:08,401
democracy versus Nazism,

1668
01:36:08,571 --> 01:36:10,335
armies of millions

1669
01:36:10,506 --> 01:36:12,133
bleeding into the ground,

1670
01:36:12,341 --> 01:36:16,244
fleets of ships weighing down the oceans,

1671
01:36:16,412 --> 01:36:18,107
planes dropping bombs from the sky

1672
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:20,749
until they obliterated the sun itself...

1673
01:36:22,284 --> 01:36:25,948
The war wasn't like that for us.

1674
01:36:27,289 --> 01:36:29,223
For us, it was just...

1675
01:36:30,893 --> 01:36:32,884
...half a dozen crossword enthusiasts

1676
01:36:33,062 --> 01:36:36,225
in a tiny village in the South of England.

1677
01:36:36,398 --> 01:36:38,423
This is...

1678
01:36:38,601 --> 01:36:40,433
your victory.

1679
01:36:40,603 --> 01:36:43,800
Victory...

1680
01:36:43,973 --> 01:36:45,998
of the cause of freedom

1681
01:36:46,208 --> 01:36:47,767
in every land.

1682
01:36:52,281 --> 01:36:56,081
This is a solemn but glorious hour.

1683
01:36:56,252 --> 01:36:59,244
I wish that Franklin D. Roosevelt

1684
01:36:59,421 --> 01:37:01,480
had lived to see this day.

1685
01:37:01,657 --> 01:37:02,988
Was I God?

1686
01:37:03,159 --> 01:37:05,218
No. Because...

1687
01:37:05,394 --> 01:37:07,920
God didn't win the war.

1688
01:37:08,097 --> 01:37:10,122
We did.

1689
01:37:22,845 --> 01:37:26,247
So, what happens now?

1690
01:37:26,415 --> 01:37:30,181
Is it... back to university for us, I suppose?

1691
01:37:30,352 --> 01:37:31,911
Yes, pretty much.

1692
01:37:32,087 --> 01:37:33,418
But you've one thing left to do

1693
01:37:33,589 --> 01:37:34,681
before your service to your government

1694
01:37:34,857 --> 01:37:36,916
- in concluded.
-What's that?

1695
01:37:37,092 --> 01:37:38,924
Burn everything.

1696
01:37:39,094 --> 01:37:41,119
- Burn? Why?
-You were told when you started

1697
01:37:41,297 --> 01:37:46,030
This was a top-secret program...did you think we were joking?

1698
01:37:46,202 --> 01:37:47,931
- But the war is over.
-This war is.

1699
01:37:48,103 --> 01:37:49,798
But there'll be others.

1700
01:37:49,972 --> 01:37:52,168
And we know how to break a code

1701
01:37:52,341 --> 01:37:55,606
that everybody else believes is unbreakable.

1702
01:37:55,778 --> 01:37:58,179
Precisely.

1703
01:37:58,347 --> 01:38:00,645
Tear it down.Light it up.

1704
01:38:00,816 --> 01:38:02,341
Sweep away the ashes.

1705
01:38:02,518 --> 01:38:03,883
None of you have ever met before.

1706
01:38:04,053 --> 01:38:07,455
None of you have ever even heard the word Enigma.

1707
01:38:08,991 --> 01:38:11,722
Have a safe trip home.

1708
01:38:14,063 --> 01:38:17,328
Behave. With a bit of luck, you'll never have

1709
01:38:17,499 --> 01:38:20,958
to see me or one another again for the rest of your lives.

1710
01:38:35,918 --> 01:38:39,218
That's unbelievable.

1711
01:38:40,389 --> 01:38:43,552
Now, Detective,

1712
01:38:43,726 --> 01:38:45,888
you get to judge.

1713
01:38:47,563 --> 01:38:51,227
So, tell me...

1714
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:53,425
what am I?

1715
01:38:54,503 --> 01:38:56,164
Mm, am I...

1716
01:38:56,338 --> 01:38:57,464
a machine?

1717
01:38:57,673 --> 01:38:59,937
Am I a person?

1718
01:39:00,109 --> 01:39:02,601
Am I a war hero?

1719
01:39:04,647 --> 01:39:07,275
Am I a criminal?

1720
01:39:10,552 --> 01:39:12,782
I can't judge you.

1721
01:39:15,557 --> 01:39:17,889
Well, then...

1722
01:39:20,396 --> 01:39:23,730
...you're no help to me at all.

1723
01:39:25,301 --> 01:39:27,463
Come in.

1724
01:39:32,207 --> 01:39:34,437
You wanted to see me, sir?

1725
01:39:34,610 --> 01:39:36,510
Turing. Sit down.

1726
01:39:48,290 --> 01:39:50,657
Something the matter?

1727
01:39:50,826 --> 01:39:53,659
You and Christopher Morcom are quite close.

1728
01:39:53,829 --> 01:39:55,024
I wouldn't say that.

1729
01:39:55,230 --> 01:39:56,629
Well, your mathematics teacher

1730
01:39:56,799 --> 01:39:58,893
says the two of you are positively inseparable.

1731
01:39:59,034 --> 01:40:01,230
We're the best students in the class.

1732
01:40:01,403 --> 01:40:03,770
He caught you passing notes the other day.

1733
01:40:03,939 --> 01:40:07,068
Cryptography, to pass the time. The class is too simple.

1734
01:40:07,242 --> 01:40:10,678
You and your friend solve maths problems during maths class

1735
01:40:10,846 --> 01:40:12,905
because the maths class is too dull?

1736
01:40:13,082 --> 01:40:14,914
He's not my friend.

1737
01:40:15,084 --> 01:40:17,348
Well, I'm told he's your only friend.

1738
01:40:17,519 --> 01:40:19,146
Who said that?

1739
01:40:21,523 --> 01:40:24,925
Something's come up concerning Morcom.

1740
01:40:25,094 --> 01:40:27,461
Why am I here?

1741
01:40:29,598 --> 01:40:32,795
Christopher is dead.

1742
01:40:39,341 --> 01:40:41,207
I don't understand.

1743
01:40:41,377 --> 01:40:43,368
His mother sent word this morning.

1744
01:40:43,545 --> 01:40:46,037
The family were on holiday, you see.

1745
01:40:50,019 --> 01:40:51,851
I don't understand.

1746
01:40:52,021 --> 01:40:54,547
Well, he had bovine tuberculosis,

1747
01:40:54,723 --> 01:40:56,953
as I'm sure he told you.

1748
01:40:57,126 --> 01:40:59,458
So this won't come as a shock, but...

1749
01:40:59,628 --> 01:41:01,722
still, all the same,

1750
01:41:01,897 --> 01:41:04,491
I'm sorry.

1751
01:41:04,666 --> 01:41:07,567
You're mistaken.

1752
01:41:07,736 --> 01:41:10,205
Did he not tell you?

1753
01:41:10,372 --> 01:41:13,000
Well, he's been sick for a long time.

1754
01:41:13,175 --> 01:41:15,701
He knew this was coming soon.

1755
01:41:15,878 --> 01:41:18,404
But he had a stiff upper lip about it.

1756
01:41:18,580 --> 01:41:21,072
Good lad.

1757
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:23,878
- Are you all right, Turing?
-Yes. Of course.

1758
01:41:24,053 --> 01:41:26,750
Like I said,I didn't know him very well.

1759
01:41:26,922 --> 01:41:29,448
Ah. I see.

1760
01:41:29,658 --> 01:41:31,592
Very well.

1761
01:41:34,563 --> 01:41:37,089
May I leave, Headmaster?

1762
01:41:51,613 --> 01:41:54,048
Congratulations, sir.

1763
01:42:20,242 --> 01:42:21,767
Sorry.

1764
01:42:26,148 --> 01:42:28,014
I would have come.

1765
01:42:28,217 --> 01:42:29,981
I would have testified.

1766
01:42:30,152 --> 01:42:32,644
And what would you have said,that I, uh...

1767
01:42:32,821 --> 01:42:34,880
I wasn't a homosexual.

1768
01:42:35,057 --> 01:42:37,082
Alan... this is serious.

1769
01:42:37,259 --> 01:42:38,590
They could send you to jail.

1770
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:41,229
Damn it.

1771
01:42:41,363 --> 01:42:43,889
Your hands.You're twitching.

1772
01:42:44,066 --> 01:42:46,330
No-no, I'm not.

1773
01:42:46,502 --> 01:42:47,799
- Alan.
-Uh...

1774
01:42:49,671 --> 01:42:52,231
It's the medication.

1775
01:42:52,407 --> 01:42:54,307
The medication?

1776
01:42:54,476 --> 01:42:57,776
Uh, well, the judge gave me, um, a choice...

1777
01:42:57,946 --> 01:43:00,779
uh, ei-either two years in prison

1778
01:43:00,949 --> 01:43:03,646
or... ho-hormonal therapy.

1779
01:43:03,819 --> 01:43:05,184
Oh, my God.

1780
01:43:05,354 --> 01:43:06,617
Oh, my God.

1781
01:43:06,788 --> 01:43:08,620
Yes, yes, that's right.

1782
01:43:08,790 --> 01:43:10,622
Chemical castration.

1783
01:43:10,792 --> 01:43:13,318
Um, to, uh, to cure me of my, um...

1784
01:43:13,495 --> 01:43:15,589
homosexual predilections.

1785
01:43:15,764 --> 01:43:17,926
Well, of course I chose that.

1786
01:43:18,100 --> 01:43:20,626
I mean, I... couldn't...

1787
01:43:20,802 --> 01:43:23,134
work in prison, and, uh...

1788
01:43:23,305 --> 01:43:24,602
All right.

1789
01:43:26,942 --> 01:43:28,569
Now, I-I'm going to speak to your doctors.

1790
01:43:28,777 --> 01:43:31,838
- I'm going to speak to your lawyers.
-I'm-I'm fine.

1791
01:43:32,014 --> 01:43:35,109
- Please let me help you.
-No, I, uh, don't need your help,

1792
01:43:35,284 --> 01:43:36,513
thank you.

1793
01:43:36,685 --> 01:43:38,710
Alan, you do not have to do this alone.

1794
01:43:40,055 --> 01:43:42,149
I'm not alone.

1795
01:43:45,327 --> 01:43:48,297
Never have been.

1796
01:43:50,999 --> 01:43:54,162
Christopher's become so smart.

1797
01:43:57,039 --> 01:43:59,701
If-if I don't continue my treatment,

1798
01:43:59,875 --> 01:44:02,173
then they'll, um...

1799
01:44:04,546 --> 01:44:07,174
...they'll take him away from me.

1800
01:44:08,584 --> 01:44:10,177
You...

1801
01:44:12,487 --> 01:44:16,253
You-you can't let them do that. You can't.

1802
01:44:17,726 --> 01:44:20,991
You... you can't let them leave me alone.

1803
01:44:22,831 --> 01:44:25,493
I don't...I don't want to be alone.

1804
01:44:25,667 --> 01:44:28,830
- I don't want to be alone.
-All ri... all right, all right.

1805
01:44:29,004 --> 01:44:30,199
All right.

1806
01:44:31,740 --> 01:44:34,334
It's all right.Come and sit down.

1807
01:44:36,545 --> 01:44:38,035
It's all right.

1808
01:44:38,213 --> 01:44:40,113
Come and sit down.

1809
01:44:41,850 --> 01:44:44,444
It's all right.

1810
01:44:55,764 --> 01:44:57,630
Oh, well, that's a...

1811
01:44:57,799 --> 01:44:59,927
that's a much nicer ring

1812
01:45:00,102 --> 01:45:02,594
than the one I-l made you.

1813
01:45:02,771 --> 01:45:05,069
Yes. His name's Jock.

1814
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:06,935
He's an Army man,

1815
01:45:07,109 --> 01:45:08,770
if you can believe it.

1816
01:45:08,944 --> 01:45:12,244
We work together.

1817
01:45:13,815 --> 01:45:17,410
Why don't we do a crossword puzzle.

1818
01:45:17,586 --> 01:45:20,385
It'll only take us five minutes.

1819
01:45:20,555 --> 01:45:22,080
Or, in your case, six.

1820
01:45:27,162 --> 01:45:29,130
There.

1821
01:45:34,803 --> 01:45:37,135
Uh...

1822
01:45:44,579 --> 01:45:45,978
Uh...

1823
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:54,321
Uh, p... perhaps later.

1824
01:45:54,489 --> 01:45:56,617
Yes, of course.

1825
01:46:01,663 --> 01:46:04,860
You-you got what you wanted, didn't you?

1826
01:46:05,033 --> 01:46:07,968
Work, a husband.

1827
01:46:08,136 --> 01:46:10,867
Normal life.

1828
01:46:20,549 --> 01:46:23,541
No one normal could have done that.

1829
01:46:26,555 --> 01:46:28,387
Do you know, this morning...

1830
01:46:28,557 --> 01:46:31,618
I was on a train

1831
01:46:31,793 --> 01:46:34,319
that went through a city that wouldn't exist

1832
01:46:34,496 --> 01:46:36,965
if it wasn't for you.

1833
01:46:37,132 --> 01:46:40,363
I bought a ticket from a man

1834
01:46:40,535 --> 01:46:44,062
who would likely be dead if it wasn't for you.

1835
01:46:44,239 --> 01:46:45,832
I read up
on my work...

1836
01:46:48,343 --> 01:46:51,904
a whole field of scientific inquiry

1837
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:55,311
that only exists because of you.

1838
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:02,882
Now, if you wish you could have been normal...

1839
01:47:03,058 --> 01:47:05,993
I can promise you I do not.

1840
01:47:07,996 --> 01:47:10,590
The world is an infinitely better place

1841
01:47:10,766 --> 01:47:13,497
precisely because you weren't.

1842
01:47:16,905 --> 01:47:17,895
Do you...

1843
01:47:18,073 --> 01:47:21,373
do you really think that?

1844
01:47:22,511 --> 01:47:24,502
I think...

1845
01:47:24,646 --> 01:47:26,546
that sometimes it is the people

1846
01:47:26,715 --> 01:47:29,082
who no one imagines anything of

1847
01:47:29,251 --> 01:47:31,413
who do the things

1848
01:47:31,586 --> 01:47:35,079
that no one can imagine.

1850
01:47:36,305 --> 01:47:42,649
