1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,200
See you, Jimmy.

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:12,400
Everyone, thank you for coming to Mission
Impossible to Final Reckoning.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,280
Every mission has led to this.

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,560
There are so many people are in comparable
director Krista from Macquarie.

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,240
My producing partner are fantastic and
extraordinary cast and crew.

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,953
They work very, very
hard to bring you the

7
00:00:27,954 --> 00:00:30,020
most authentic cinema
experience that we could.

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,696
So we are all so happy that
you were here in this theater

9
00:00:33,697 --> 00:00:37,360
to watch the biggest
mission yet on the big screen.

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,400
The way it was meant to be seen.

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,600
So please enjoy the show.

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,760
We made a few.

13
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,900
Thank you.

14
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,850
We did a die in the shadows.

15
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,370
For those we were close.

16
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,690
And for those we never made.

17
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,290
The end of the film is filled.

18
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:31,310
It's cool.

19
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:32,070
There they go.

20
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,050
This entity has multiple personalities.

21
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,150
This thing has a mind.

22
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,090
It's so fluid.

23
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,450
Self-realizing truth.

24
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,030
It's an digital parasite.

25
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,390
Fasting on the side.

26
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:41,990
It's amazing.

27
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,570
It's everywhere.
And nowhere.

28
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,070
And it has no situation.

29
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:45,730
We listen.

30
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,210
We didn't watch those.

31
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,790
There are too many personal secrets.

32
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,110
For years.

33
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,870
We're kind of like now, right?

34
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,190
Or be anyone.

35
00:01:53,191 --> 00:01:55,790
in the day is not me to ta
to you to the end of the day.

36
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,010
And we're from home 
to the end of the world.

37
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,770
And most of your days
and years are reached.

38
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,186
And you're up the
end of the world.

39
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,650
And most of my
heart is very strong.

40
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,770
And my allies and one
have been explored.

41
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,670
And every week we'll start
to meet these intercessors.

42
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,490
Some will force it to start to power.

43
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,910
We just stay west and everything.

44
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,210
The world is changing.

45
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,290
Truth is finishing.

46
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,610
All is coming.

47
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,250
Good evening, even.

48
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,070
This is your precedent.

49
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,110
Since you won't reply to anyone else,
I thought I'd reach out directly.

50
00:02:55,330 --> 00:03:01,830
First, I want to thank you for a lifetime
of devoted and unrelenting service.

51
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,470
We're in not for the tireless
dedication of you and your team.

52
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:12,070
The earth would be
a very different place.

53
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,950
It might not even be here at all.

54
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,230
Every risk you take in.

55
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,150
Every comrade you've lost in the field.

56
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:36,250
Every personal sacrifice you made has
brought this world another sunrise.

57
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,930
It's been 35 years since
circumstances brought you to us.

58
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,770
And you were given the choice.

59
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,070
Since the IMF saved
you from a life in prison.

60
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,730
And though you never bothered
orders, you never let us down.

61
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,970
You were always the best of man.

62
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,590
In the worst of times.

63
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,640
I need you to be that man now.

64
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,420
In the months since you evaded capture in
Austria, every corner of cyberspace has

65
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:42,560
been infested by the truth-eating
parasitic AI known to us as the entity.

66
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,620
Under his influence, digital information
has been corrupted worldwide.

67
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,870
Nations and people no
longer know what to believe.

68
00:04:50,871 --> 00:04:55,810
Antagonism, aggression and
martial law are the new world border.

69
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,530
Exploring this paranoid atmosphere,
the entity has inspired a dual-stake halt

70
00:05:00,531 --> 00:05:05,608
with alkalites devoted to really the world
of corruption through human extinction.

71
00:05:05,901 --> 00:05:07,402
The Lord said to Noah: "Here I am.

72
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,026
I send a flood upon the earth.

73
00:05:09,486 --> 00:05:11,068
Let every fleshly person perish."

74
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:13,233
The children of the atom
will rise from the ashes.

75
00:05:13,528 --> 00:05:15,026
The entity will help them rebuild.

76
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:17,567
These fanatists are
secretly working to infiltrate

77
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,030
at all levels of the security apparatus.

78
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:21,401
Governments, and our militaries.

79
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:24,735
They are dedicated to serving
their digital master's ultimate goal.

80
00:05:25,143 --> 00:05:31,485
Our only hope of controlling the entity
relies on finding its original source code.

81
00:05:31,784 --> 00:05:35,923
If anyone knows what we're
about of this code, it's this man.

82
00:05:36,463 --> 00:05:40,554
His identity, his past, his
very existence have been

83
00:05:40,555 --> 00:05:45,303
erased suggesting he is or
was in league with the entity.

84
00:05:45,943 --> 00:05:48,355
Austrian authorities
have his accomplice in

85
00:05:48,356 --> 00:05:51,884
custody, which he is
refused to tell us anything.

86
00:05:52,443 --> 00:05:55,083
Which brings us back to you.

87
00:05:55,084 --> 00:06:00,003
You are in position of a team,
believed to be a vital component in our

88
00:06:00,004 --> 00:06:02,443
struggle to acquire
the entity's source code.

89
00:06:02,803 --> 00:06:06,486
Yet you refuse to come in,
fearing any government will

90
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:09,903
weaponize this malicious AI
against the rest of the world.

91
00:06:10,723 --> 00:06:13,683
Instead, you've resolved to
kill the entity, a reckless act

92
00:06:13,684 --> 00:06:17,003
that would trigger the total
annihilation of cyberspace.

93
00:06:17,603 --> 00:06:20,422
This will eradicate the
global economy, plunging

94
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:23,923
the world into war
and famine without end.

95
00:06:24,923 --> 00:06:29,003
Agent Hunt, Ethan,
please surrender, where

96
00:06:29,004 --> 00:06:33,144
the blood of the world
will be on your hands.

97
00:06:34,123 --> 00:06:37,643
This message will
self-destruct in five seconds.

98
00:06:38,743 --> 00:06:43,563
Come home, Ethan,
and bring us that key.

99
00:08:18,243 --> 00:08:19,723
Hey, Ethan.

100
00:08:21,163 --> 00:08:23,363
Sorry about the core.

101
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:28,123
The rich books are, but it's
dreams for you, from pillows.

102
00:08:28,423 --> 00:08:30,463
Yeah, many more.

103
00:08:32,163 --> 00:08:33,543
First of all, I came.

104
00:08:46,673 --> 00:08:51,033
It's always been to see you
on the right side of the grass.

105
00:08:52,513 --> 00:08:54,453
I'm worried you're working too hard.

106
00:08:55,713 --> 00:08:57,433
Don't worry about all of them.

107
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:02,433
So, what did you
manage to find out?

108
00:09:03,593 --> 00:09:04,593
Hold on.

109
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:07,893
I'm not worried of you.

110
00:09:10,153 --> 00:09:11,253
So what's the play?

111
00:09:11,773 --> 00:09:13,813
First, we have to find you.

112
00:09:14,633 --> 00:09:16,153
How do we find you?

113
00:10:40,313 --> 00:10:41,313
Wait,

114
00:10:45,753 --> 00:10:47,613
wait, wait, wait, wait, you call that in.

115
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:48,969
See, I don't want to close that.

116
00:10:48,993 --> 00:10:49,993
They guys.

117
00:10:50,593 --> 00:10:51,773
Clark is running in.

118
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:52,713
You take us in.

119
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,953
There won't be anyone on earth who can
stop it.

120
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:56,373
Has a part of you to know that.

121
00:10:56,993 --> 00:10:57,993
I can see it.

122
00:10:58,913 --> 00:11:00,713
We've got to say, to try to get out.

123
00:11:01,073 --> 00:11:02,253
It's okay, it's okay.

124
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:03,073
It's okay.

125
00:11:03,113 --> 00:11:03,273
It's okay.

126
00:11:03,433 --> 00:11:04,893
So, nations on this one.

127
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:06,913
So, arrive while you have to use no
doctor.

128
00:11:07,273 --> 00:11:08,493
It's who keeps their head.

129
00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:09,853
And who can it?

130
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:12,973
The entity wants you scary, wants us all
scared.

131
00:11:13,593 --> 00:11:14,693
And wants us divided.

132
00:11:15,653 --> 00:11:17,293
It wants you to turn us in.

133
00:11:18,173 --> 00:11:19,173
Don't, don't.

134
00:11:23,673 --> 00:11:24,933
It's okay.

135
00:11:26,273 --> 00:11:26,753
It's okay.

136
00:11:26,754 --> 00:11:27,754
Please, take it.

137
00:11:29,513 --> 00:11:30,513
Please.

138
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:24,963
You should be in
there without backup.

139
00:12:25,603 --> 00:12:26,603
Bet you, please.

140
00:12:26,683 --> 00:12:27,683
We got this.

141
00:12:27,803 --> 00:12:28,863
This is a terrible idea.

142
00:12:29,243 --> 00:12:29,803
Just relax.

143
00:12:29,963 --> 00:12:32,003
In this place is crawling
with clandestine services.

144
00:12:32,163 --> 00:12:33,239
You should get out of that.

145
00:12:33,263 --> 00:12:34,263
It's okay.

146
00:12:35,023 --> 00:12:35,323
It's okay.

147
00:12:35,324 --> 00:12:38,383
I don't think everyone would
risk coming to that party.

148
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,063
I bought.

149
00:12:39,563 --> 00:12:41,303
Nothing is just so good now.

150
00:12:41,863 --> 00:12:42,863
It's here.

151
00:12:43,843 --> 00:12:44,723
It's gotta be here.

152
00:12:44,863 --> 00:12:46,123
You think we could say goodbye?

153
00:12:47,203 --> 00:12:48,463
I'm following you.

154
00:12:49,483 --> 00:12:54,323
I'm following you.

155
00:12:54,863 --> 00:12:55,863
Stay with you.

156
00:12:58,063 --> 00:12:59,063
The most...

157
00:13:02,453 --> 00:13:04,313
Are you sure it's really new?

158
00:13:09,293 --> 00:13:10,453
Oh, you're not sure.

159
00:13:10,593 --> 00:13:11,653
You have fun to hurt me.

160
00:13:11,793 --> 00:13:12,793
Come here.

161
00:13:19,393 --> 00:13:20,393
Nice.

162
00:13:31,563 --> 00:13:33,763
I didn't see you with that one.

163
00:13:33,983 --> 00:13:34,283
Awesome.

164
00:13:34,383 --> 00:13:35,063
It's a good people.

165
00:13:35,303 --> 00:13:35,343
Okay.

166
00:13:36,003 --> 00:13:37,003
We're grateful.

167
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,483
Okay.

168
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:41,123
Gentlemen.

169
00:13:59,313 --> 00:14:00,313
That's a personal.

170
00:14:05,703 --> 00:14:07,963
You know, I like the long tail.

171
00:14:08,063 --> 00:14:09,863
I really appreciate your coming.

172
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:11,383
But you shouldn't be here.

173
00:14:11,443 --> 00:14:12,683
I didn't have much choice.

174
00:14:13,843 --> 00:14:15,043
Will you expect me to be true?

175
00:14:15,223 --> 00:14:20,043
I expect you to save him from
himself and the world from him.

176
00:14:22,223 --> 00:14:23,223
You can't treat you.

177
00:14:25,043 --> 00:14:26,183
You just got your job.

178
00:14:26,703 --> 00:14:27,783
One of trouble, Greta.

179
00:14:27,963 --> 00:14:29,543
The whole world's in, don't leave me.

180
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:31,923
You're the only one
I trust to save him.

181
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:36,923
So, what's the play?

182
00:14:40,983 --> 00:14:41,983
Okay.

183
00:14:42,203 --> 00:14:43,203
Great.

184
00:14:50,403 --> 00:14:50,883
Great.

185
00:14:51,163 --> 00:14:52,488
Gabriel's a good job for you, Hunt.

186
00:14:56,651 --> 00:14:58,238
Ethan, wake up!

187
00:15:00,735 --> 00:15:01,488
Okay.

188
00:15:02,112 --> 00:15:02,900
What do we do?

189
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:05,567
Tell me you have a plan.

190
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,219
They took my watch.

191
00:15:12,526 --> 00:15:13,529
Your watch?
- Yeah.

192
00:15:13,626 --> 00:15:14,626
It might have legs.

193
00:15:15,466 --> 00:15:16,466
I'd locked it similarly.

194
00:15:17,006 --> 00:15:17,366
I see.

195
00:15:17,866 --> 00:15:18,966
Why do I have?

196
00:15:19,026 --> 00:15:19,426
Okay.

197
00:15:19,526 --> 00:15:20,526
Now listen.

198
00:15:23,946 --> 00:15:25,186
Let's do it.

199
00:15:26,406 --> 00:15:27,406
Let's go.

200
00:15:28,766 --> 00:15:29,766
Guys, look at me.

201
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:30,666
Look at me.

202
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:31,867
You're gonna get through this.

203
00:15:34,486 --> 00:15:35,566
Okay, through what?

204
00:15:36,306 --> 00:15:38,306
Just keep telling yourself.

205
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:40,286
It's only pain.

206
00:15:47,486 --> 00:15:47,786
Stop!

207
00:15:48,226 --> 00:15:49,726
Don't touch him!

208
00:15:52,126 --> 00:15:53,526
You can't hurt him.

209
00:15:57,266 --> 00:15:58,426
Not that way.

210
00:16:00,986 --> 00:16:02,046
Take you back to Shanghai...

211
00:16:03,306 --> 00:16:04,306
What was your name?

212
00:16:05,246 --> 00:16:06,246
Julia.

213
00:16:06,946 --> 00:16:08,286
A former Mrs. Hunt.

214
00:16:09,126 --> 00:16:11,106
Did you even fail to mention that?

215
00:16:12,066 --> 00:16:14,286
Something David took her.

216
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,566
He demanded a ransom for her.

217
00:16:16,886 --> 00:16:20,446
For something only Ethan took him.

218
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,146
David called it the rabbit's foot.

219
00:16:23,826 --> 00:16:25,026
But it has another name.

220
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:27,886
Against God.

221
00:16:28,926 --> 00:16:31,426
I never told you what
was in that chemistry today.

222
00:16:32,226 --> 00:16:33,406
But you always wondered.

223
00:16:33,407 --> 00:16:35,826
Still in the rabbit's foot.

224
00:16:36,026 --> 00:16:37,046
It was just one event.

225
00:16:37,406 --> 00:16:41,606
And a lifelong pattern
repeating itself over and over.

226
00:16:42,286 --> 00:16:44,126
For every life is tried to save.

227
00:16:44,286 --> 00:16:45,706
It's gambled millions more.

228
00:16:46,746 --> 00:16:48,646
But then down and down again.

229
00:16:49,186 --> 00:16:52,366
And another fate of
every living soul on earth.

230
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:54,686
This is responsibility.

231
00:16:55,946 --> 00:16:57,326
You must be exhausted.

232
00:16:58,706 --> 00:16:59,706
Where's the key?

233
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:01,646
Let it go.

234
00:17:01,766 --> 00:17:02,766
Then we'll discuss it.

235
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:04,406
We don't have the time.

236
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,426
Some of you who
close will die tonight.

237
00:17:08,286 --> 00:17:10,846
For the sake of those
you will never meet.

238
00:17:11,146 --> 00:17:13,266
Unless you do exactly as I say.

239
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,066
He also said the key would
be his own train remember.

240
00:17:17,646 --> 00:17:19,266
You have one joke.

241
00:17:19,986 --> 00:17:20,986
Get on the train.

242
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,166
Get the key.

243
00:17:22,406 --> 00:17:23,566
Get off the train.

244
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:27,986
How did you most detail the news
and have found out you blew it?

245
00:17:28,886 --> 00:17:29,786
You failed.

246
00:17:29,787 --> 00:17:33,086
And how did he have
to use forsaken you?

247
00:17:33,306 --> 00:17:35,046
You're choosing to
compromise, Jason.

248
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:38,046
I know what Luther's doing.

249
00:17:38,366 --> 00:17:39,726
I know what you're planning.

250
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,406
Resist me and I'll
make you pay dearly.

251
00:17:43,106 --> 00:17:44,106
If you cooperate.

252
00:17:45,246 --> 00:17:46,246
I can help.

253
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,666
He says for what?

254
00:17:48,406 --> 00:17:50,086
You're searching for a Russian submarine.

255
00:17:50,366 --> 00:17:51,786
Vanished on its main voyage.

256
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:54,406
The K-559 is a festival.

257
00:17:55,086 --> 00:17:58,806
A state of the art submarine completely
undetectable to any known sign-on.

258
00:17:58,807 --> 00:18:02,106
And the secret to its
invisibility was that.

259
00:18:02,306 --> 00:18:03,306
The part covert.

260
00:18:03,726 --> 00:18:08,286
A counter-acoustic algorithmic drive
located in the sivastable Sinai sphere.

261
00:18:08,946 --> 00:18:13,226
Now, in the winter of 2012, the Russians
discovered a computer virus of unknown

262
00:18:13,227 --> 00:18:15,326
origins spreading
through their black sea flint.

263
00:18:16,086 --> 00:18:17,926
A digital covert operative.

264
00:18:18,106 --> 00:18:22,446
We suspect this mystery virus was only
intended to sabotage the pod-cover,

265
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:24,086
rendering the submarine detectable.

266
00:18:25,026 --> 00:18:27,906
Instead, it tricked the
crew into sickle themselves.

267
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,086
Check it.

268
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:30,886
Or on top, it was not responding.

269
00:18:31,126 --> 00:18:31,926
It's coming like that.

270
00:18:32,106 --> 00:18:35,967
All the meters, all the waves, four, all
the people who set up the simulation.

271
00:18:37,026 --> 00:18:40,826
If we're right, the one thing we need to
kill the entity.

272
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,206
It's a regional source code.

273
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:46,306
It's buried in the
sivastable solar sphere.

274
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:48,626
Somewhere deep at
the bottom of the ocean.

275
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,166
Frozen in time.

276
00:18:50,626 --> 00:18:53,166
Where even the entity can't reach it.

277
00:18:53,506 --> 00:18:57,586
Now, the pod-cover's housing was
designed to self-destruct if tampered with.

278
00:18:57,587 --> 00:19:03,866
The only way to safely open it is with a
specially designed, cruciform team.

279
00:19:04,486 --> 00:19:08,986
The two halves of which were held by the
sivastable spacecraft in the next zone.

280
00:19:09,506 --> 00:19:11,226
They were brought from
the Dristman package.

281
00:19:11,926 --> 00:19:18,366
In the spring of 2012, by in your
divisional, a man of your skills,

282
00:19:18,906 --> 00:19:23,666
now is all he needs to pinpoint
that some town to the square yard.

283
00:19:24,606 --> 00:19:28,006
You think I'm going to get the
source code and bring it to you.

284
00:19:28,106 --> 00:19:30,226
I don't think.
I know.

285
00:19:30,986 --> 00:19:32,106
I know what you go.

286
00:19:32,426 --> 00:19:36,166
Then you're going to find the entity's
source code and bring it to me.

287
00:19:36,286 --> 00:19:37,666
And exchange for grace.

288
00:19:38,346 --> 00:19:40,146
Then I'll take control of the entity.

289
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:46,846
If you're very routinely, you let out the
rabbit's foot.

290
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:47,786
They had to go.

291
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:50,626
It wasn't a biological or chemical weapon.

292
00:19:50,766 --> 00:19:51,786
It took from family life.

293
00:19:52,386 --> 00:19:56,605
The file you traded for Julia
contained malicious code,

294
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:58,967
the primordial digital rules.

295
00:19:59,206 --> 00:20:00,806
From which a weapon evolved.

296
00:20:01,986 --> 00:20:04,126
A weapon that used
couldn't make work.

297
00:20:04,626 --> 00:20:07,066
A weapon the West might
never have made on my own.

298
00:20:07,226 --> 00:20:08,786
You didn't know what
you were speaking.

299
00:20:09,846 --> 00:20:10,846
You never stayed.

300
00:20:11,366 --> 00:20:13,006
I know why I was telling you.

301
00:20:14,386 --> 00:20:15,866
I kicked out my life.

302
00:20:15,867 --> 00:20:17,266
I was still in the rabbit's foot.

303
00:20:17,626 --> 00:20:18,886
I could get back.

304
00:20:20,006 --> 00:20:21,946
I think that's the greatest
way to say anything.

305
00:20:23,366 --> 00:20:27,386
Without you even
there'd be no entity.

306
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:31,526
And if you don't find that
sub in the next few days.

307
00:20:31,946 --> 00:20:34,026
This hand of the world is we know it.

308
00:20:34,786 --> 00:20:36,826
And the world be his fault.

309
00:20:38,806 --> 00:20:39,806
And nothing.

310
00:20:40,846 --> 00:20:42,146
Look at me.

311
00:20:42,626 --> 00:20:43,666
Tell me I'm wrong.

312
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:57,336
Force use.

313
00:20:57,876 --> 00:21:00,556
Find that guy for me.

314
00:21:00,596 --> 00:21:03,516
I bite down my mission.
I'm dead in 60 seconds.

315
00:21:04,356 --> 00:21:05,636
You'll never see that short.

316
00:21:05,976 --> 00:21:07,276
Don't touch him.

317
00:21:08,296 --> 00:21:09,296
Spit him out.

318
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:10,336
Really he's reversed.

319
00:21:11,196 --> 00:21:12,376
You won't do it.

320
00:21:12,536 --> 00:21:13,676
I got nothing to lose.

321
00:21:14,456 --> 00:21:17,576
The great status has you dead.

322
00:21:18,216 --> 00:21:20,456
Who's gonna save her?

323
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:21,996
Spit him out.

324
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:24,956
Have you ever seen him?

325
00:21:24,957 --> 00:21:26,136
You're never seen him.

326
00:21:26,137 --> 00:21:28,996
I saw you biting me.

327
00:21:30,636 --> 00:21:32,016
Let him be back!

328
00:21:35,176 --> 00:21:36,996
Let him be back!

329
00:21:37,216 --> 00:21:38,356
Let him be back!

330
00:21:39,176 --> 00:21:39,216
Let him be back!

331
00:21:39,217 --> 00:21:39,696
Come on.

332
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:40,956
Wait, wait, wait.

333
00:21:40,957 --> 00:21:41,957
Charging?

334
00:21:42,646 --> 00:21:43,646
Charging.

335
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:44,916
Hey.

336
00:21:49,156 --> 00:21:50,156
Hey!

337
00:21:51,536 --> 00:21:52,536
Hey!

338
00:22:01,316 --> 00:22:02,616
Hey, what's going on?

339
00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:09,066
Hey, what's going on?

340
00:22:45,276 --> 00:22:46,276
Hey,

341
00:22:55,176 --> 00:23:03,736
what's going on?

342
00:23:19,586 --> 00:23:21,026
Hey, what's going on?

343
00:23:22,866 --> 00:23:23,126
Hey, what's going on?

344
00:23:23,127 --> 00:23:24,127
Great.

345
00:23:24,726 --> 00:23:28,886
Oh, hey, you don't think that I would have
left them.

346
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,586
First of all, never let anything happen to
him.

347
00:23:32,046 --> 00:23:33,246
I think I'm serious.

348
00:23:34,286 --> 00:23:38,307
I mean, I was... What?

349
00:23:38,346 --> 00:23:39,346
I have been hanging.

350
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:41,966
I think we're gonna have to kill you.

351
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:42,546
Yeah.

352
00:23:43,346 --> 00:23:44,346
Yeah.

353
00:23:45,066 --> 00:23:47,006
Hey, get it right by the way.

354
00:23:48,966 --> 00:23:49,966
Where are you at?

355
00:25:05,186 --> 00:25:06,406
We're talking about this.

356
00:25:06,726 --> 00:25:08,006
Are you supposed to have a life?

357
00:25:08,066 --> 00:25:09,506
Have a life.

358
00:25:10,146 --> 00:25:11,746
You're supposed to have a life.

359
00:25:11,747 --> 00:26:19,976
Where are you from?

360
00:26:57,136 --> 00:27:00,476
You're not serious about me.

361
00:27:30,056 --> 00:27:32,576
Alright, I'm here.

362
00:27:33,236 --> 00:27:34,236
Now what do you want?

363
00:27:39,676 --> 00:27:42,076
Good evening, Mr. Hunt.

364
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,456
You have questions.

365
00:27:45,356 --> 00:27:47,696
The answer is answers.

366
00:27:48,996 --> 00:27:51,016
But you have to let it in.

367
00:28:02,476 --> 00:28:03,776
There's a new name.

368
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:05,316
If you're serious.

369
00:28:10,396 --> 00:28:13,416
Again, you know this place.

370
00:28:16,056 --> 00:28:17,716
The doomsday fuck.

371
00:28:18,476 --> 00:28:19,476
South Africa.

372
00:28:20,296 --> 00:28:21,836
You will need the end of your air.

373
00:28:22,396 --> 00:28:23,516
You will let it in.

374
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:27,356
And the fate of every
living thing will be decided.

375
00:28:28,476 --> 00:28:29,796
And the blink of an eye.

376
00:28:30,716 --> 00:28:31,716
This is your calling.

377
00:28:32,676 --> 00:28:33,676
And this thing.

378
00:28:34,496 --> 00:28:35,836
I don't accept it.

379
00:28:40,766 --> 00:28:42,546
You have no secrets.

380
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:47,826
You've

381
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,676
heard crucified the key.

382
00:28:54,056 --> 00:28:55,496
What magnum of this?

383
00:28:56,416 --> 00:29:00,756
The algorithm on that drive went
period with the entity source code.

384
00:29:00,856 --> 00:29:04,976
Lactus the poison bill you asked for.

385
00:29:05,976 --> 00:29:10,136
You plan to retrieve the one
cover from the source code.

386
00:29:10,256 --> 00:29:11,556
And destroy the entity.

387
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:14,076
And that scares you.

388
00:29:14,596 --> 00:29:16,776
The entity sees infinite possibility.

389
00:29:18,116 --> 00:29:20,176
And this is my cover.

390
00:29:20,656 --> 00:29:22,656
And you missed everything.

391
00:29:37,046 --> 00:29:38,946
And like the entity in.

392
00:29:39,586 --> 00:29:41,446
It is a river.

393
00:29:42,286 --> 00:29:45,046
And it is coming even.

394
00:29:46,066 --> 00:29:47,986
You have always done this.

395
00:29:48,426 --> 00:29:50,846
The entity offers
hope for the future.

396
00:29:51,966 --> 00:29:54,306
The few who survive will be stronger.

397
00:29:59,246 --> 00:30:00,526
The only.

398
00:30:01,486 --> 00:30:02,706
If you let it in.

399
00:30:03,266 --> 00:30:04,266
If I don't.

400
00:30:04,426 --> 00:30:05,426
What that?

401
00:30:05,866 --> 00:30:07,126
Destroy the world.

402
00:30:07,266 --> 00:30:09,026
And you just destroy yourself.

403
00:30:09,986 --> 00:30:11,246
The choice is yours.

404
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:13,306
The entity's future.

405
00:30:13,926 --> 00:30:15,646
Or new future at all.

406
00:30:16,186 --> 00:30:17,886
That the world being saved.

407
00:30:18,446 --> 00:30:19,646
All that the world.

408
00:30:19,866 --> 00:30:20,866
That destroyed.

409
00:30:21,626 --> 00:30:22,666
Now you.

410
00:30:22,806 --> 00:30:23,966
The Jews are my.

411
00:30:23,967 --> 00:30:26,286
A real, he's not cast.

412
00:30:27,586 --> 00:30:30,626
He has taken steps to be in control of the
empty.

413
00:30:31,366 --> 00:30:33,446
As you will see him through.

414
00:30:34,246 --> 00:30:36,726
Resist me and I'll make you pay dearly.

415
00:30:39,086 --> 00:30:42,046
Some of you close will die tonight.

416
00:30:43,426 --> 00:30:44,486
For ten.

417
00:30:45,686 --> 00:30:49,246
You know what you are needing still to
change their destiny.

418
00:30:50,326 --> 00:30:52,486
You know they can't stop the invisible.

419
00:30:53,286 --> 00:30:56,826
They will destroy themselves, believe they
have no choice.

420
00:30:58,126 --> 00:30:59,606
They'll turn on the skull.

421
00:31:00,766 --> 00:31:04,966
In four days, they will face their final
reckoning.

422
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:16,416
You're real.

423
00:32:19,136 --> 00:32:20,136
You're real.

424
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:23,906
You're real.

425
00:32:23,907 --> 00:32:24,766
It knows.

426
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:25,767
It knows all.

427
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:26,326
It depends.

428
00:32:26,626 --> 00:32:27,906
It's something you're right now.

429
00:32:28,006 --> 00:32:28,606
You'll take the team.

430
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:30,386
You'll take the North.

431
00:32:30,966 --> 00:32:33,046
North where is the first of all.

432
00:32:33,246 --> 00:32:33,906
It's the first of all.

433
00:32:34,066 --> 00:32:35,066
I have to get caught.

434
00:32:35,246 --> 00:32:36,526
It's the only way you get there.

435
00:32:36,766 --> 00:32:40,266
If you have to receive a decompression
chamber, steal a plane, I will play.

436
00:32:40,267 --> 00:32:41,667
That's what I want you to be asked.

437
00:32:42,426 --> 00:32:44,626
Do you see three of them?

438
00:32:44,826 --> 00:32:44,986
You did.

439
00:32:45,326 --> 00:32:47,222
If we were there, remember to transmit the
court.

440
00:32:47,246 --> 00:32:49,646
It's every two hours of 15 minutes on the
song again.

441
00:32:50,686 --> 00:32:51,486
18 a year now.

442
00:32:51,606 --> 00:32:52,606
No, I'm not.

443
00:32:53,026 --> 00:32:55,086
Take care of the team.

444
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:56,426
Do you still have a question?

445
00:32:56,626 --> 00:32:59,466
But what I said, please, whatever you do,
you don't matter what's still.

446
00:32:59,786 --> 00:32:59,906
Yes.

447
00:33:00,366 --> 00:33:00,366
Okay.

448
00:33:01,186 --> 00:33:02,186
There.

449
00:33:05,326 --> 00:33:06,326
Go.

450
00:33:07,546 --> 00:33:08,546
Where are you going?

451
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:10,446
Thanks, sir.

452
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:33,806
Hey, I've got the Gabriel.

453
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:37,166
Harold, I'm right, well.

454
00:35:38,146 --> 00:35:39,706
You know what I'm saying?

455
00:35:40,986 --> 00:35:43,266
So, what's blood is there?

456
00:35:43,506 --> 00:35:44,506
What?

457
00:35:45,466 --> 00:35:46,746
No, we know.

458
00:35:48,186 --> 00:35:49,006
How would I think it is?

459
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:51,546
Not too special, but don't even court.

460
00:35:52,266 --> 00:35:55,493
I'm guessing a five or
six megaton yield enough

461
00:35:55,494 --> 00:35:58,607
to turn this entire city
into a glass ash tree.

462
00:35:59,606 --> 00:36:01,466
That's... not good.

463
00:36:04,206 --> 00:36:05,486
Already tried.

464
00:36:05,487 --> 00:36:06,487
Can't open it.

465
00:36:07,506 --> 00:36:09,686
I see that Gabriel has a poison.

466
00:36:09,687 --> 00:36:12,286
Bill, you might want to find me.

467
00:36:12,386 --> 00:36:15,186
How do I, well, can you just harm that?

468
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,886
I just have to stop these nine detonators
from imploding the court.

469
00:36:19,046 --> 00:36:20,326
Attach one detonator?

470
00:36:21,066 --> 00:36:22,066
No imploding.

471
00:36:22,306 --> 00:36:24,346
And now the pollution, they'll critical
mass.

472
00:36:25,326 --> 00:36:26,666
And they'll critical mass.

473
00:36:27,386 --> 00:36:29,146
No six megaton blast.

474
00:36:29,466 --> 00:36:30,386
Now, it's the time we have.

475
00:36:30,466 --> 00:36:32,506
No time for you to get out of here.

476
00:36:32,586 --> 00:36:33,046
Maybe.

477
00:36:33,246 --> 00:36:34,822
With those tools, I get these hinges off.

478
00:36:34,846 --> 00:36:38,806
Even if you could get that gate open,
I still have to detach one detonator.

479
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,486
What do you say?

480
00:36:45,026 --> 00:36:46,926
I can save the city.

481
00:36:48,386 --> 00:36:53,186
But this entire network of tunnels is
going to cave in.

482
00:36:58,866 --> 00:37:00,926
But, detaches that detonator.

483
00:37:04,786 --> 00:37:05,906
It's going to die.

484
00:37:06,686 --> 00:37:08,726
We're both on the right side of that gate.

485
00:37:10,046 --> 00:37:14,086
And you know, listen, it's something I
have to do with that.

486
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:16,466
They won't live to you by accident,
Ethan.

487
00:37:16,786 --> 00:37:17,786
You know why?

488
00:37:22,536 --> 00:37:24,496
Gabriel needs me alive.

489
00:37:26,176 --> 00:37:31,576
And if you're dying, if you're the only
one who can make another poison bill and I

490
00:37:31,577 --> 00:37:34,816
am the only one who can get to that
submarine.

491
00:37:35,176 --> 00:37:38,416
I'll be waiting for him.

492
00:37:38,417 --> 00:37:41,796
If he has a poison bill, I'll have to
bring him to the court.

493
00:37:44,456 --> 00:37:45,516
So he can get to it.

494
00:37:47,676 --> 00:37:53,176
This is where you leave me.

495
00:37:55,046 --> 00:37:56,046
Okay.

496
00:37:57,306 --> 00:37:59,326
What are we going to do?

497
00:37:59,726 --> 00:38:00,726
We're talking.

498
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:02,646
Go fishing.

499
00:38:03,846 --> 00:38:05,206
This is my mission.

500
00:38:06,546 --> 00:38:09,146
This is what I was born to do.

501
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:10,626
Okay.

502
00:38:10,926 --> 00:38:12,386
I can't.

503
00:38:12,566 --> 00:38:14,486
It's nothing you need to say, brother.

504
00:38:15,606 --> 00:38:16,606
I know.

505
00:38:17,286 --> 00:38:18,486
I know.

506
00:38:19,686 --> 00:38:22,186
I'm right where I want to be.

507
00:38:23,686 --> 00:38:26,366
Ethan, you need to hurry.

508
00:38:28,846 --> 00:38:29,846
You go.

509
00:38:31,586 --> 00:38:32,586
Fine, Gabriel.

510
00:38:34,066 --> 00:38:35,846
Stop him.

511
00:38:37,986 --> 00:38:39,226
For those who we never need.

512
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,146
Because actually we never need.

513
00:39:11,256 --> 00:39:11,936
him.

514
00:39:11,937 --> 00:39:14,056
He will use the wish.

515
00:39:15,076 --> 00:39:17,836
No one will save from pity and strength.

516
00:40:54,576 --> 00:40:55,856
Is he dead?

517
00:40:58,416 --> 00:40:59,416
Five.

518
00:41:01,986 --> 00:41:02,306
Five.

519
00:41:02,886 --> 00:41:03,886
Ten.

520
00:41:05,186 --> 00:41:08,006
I got to see you in the other night.

521
00:41:09,286 --> 00:41:10,286
What other?

522
00:41:11,266 --> 00:41:11,606
Here we are.

523
00:41:11,607 --> 00:41:13,426
at the end of this trip, bros.

524
00:41:14,866 --> 00:41:15,906
Like your father.

525
00:41:18,686 --> 00:41:19,946
He was in the second store.

526
00:41:22,086 --> 00:41:23,806
He vanished when he was seven.

527
00:41:25,546 --> 00:41:25,986
He joined.

528
00:41:26,326 --> 00:41:29,426
If I never had control, he found out he
had legal trouble.

529
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:32,686
He was off at the choice.

530
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:35,926
He joined the IMF.

531
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:39,566
I spent the rest of his life in prison.

532
00:41:40,366 --> 00:41:41,366
Just like you, man.

533
00:41:42,906 --> 00:41:46,566
Only in your case, charges murder,
I believe.

534
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:48,606
But let me guess.

535
00:41:49,086 --> 00:41:50,086
You were framed.

536
00:41:51,366 --> 00:41:54,746
Just like you claimed you were framed all
those years ago in Prague.

537
00:41:56,226 --> 00:41:57,606
How the mission went sideways.

538
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,146
How you lost your whole team.

539
00:42:01,946 --> 00:42:03,886
Your story at my father down as a traitor.

540
00:42:05,366 --> 00:42:06,746
That's why you killed him.

541
00:42:11,986 --> 00:42:13,026
That's true.

542
00:42:13,246 --> 00:42:14,246
I wish you more.

543
00:42:16,006 --> 00:42:18,266
You think I'm carrying that?

544
00:42:19,466 --> 00:42:20,466
But I'm here for revenge?

545
00:42:22,126 --> 00:42:23,766
Or what?

546
00:42:24,486 --> 00:42:25,726
Clearly my father's name.

547
00:42:27,406 --> 00:42:29,426
It's my name now.

548
00:42:30,986 --> 00:42:31,986
No.

549
00:42:33,146 --> 00:42:34,146
I'm here.

550
00:42:35,546 --> 00:42:39,286
Because I know you're the reason of world
staring down the barrel at home again.

551
00:42:39,287 --> 00:42:44,347
And I also know it's not the first time you
gave him what the fate of me would rest.

552
00:42:46,326 --> 00:42:48,386
And none of that would matter to me.

553
00:42:49,946 --> 00:42:54,186
If he'd ever once been following orders.

554
00:42:55,926 --> 00:42:56,926
Thanks.

555
00:42:57,726 --> 00:42:58,726
Props.

556
00:43:00,006 --> 00:43:01,006
Jim.

557
00:43:02,226 --> 00:43:07,126
The answer to him once you gave me is
calling on him.

558
00:43:07,566 --> 00:43:12,326
And he only agreed to be at a district or
one thing he would never expect us to do.

559
00:43:13,646 --> 00:43:14,646
What's that?

560
00:43:24,966 --> 00:43:26,426
You forget I know you want.

561
00:43:27,906 --> 00:43:30,566
I know all your IMF, my name.

562
00:43:31,786 --> 00:43:32,866
When this is over?

563
00:43:33,466 --> 00:43:34,866
When you're done with you?

564
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:37,246
You and me?

565
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:40,166
Well, I don't want to make any.

566
00:43:47,716 --> 00:43:50,096
It's his name, I'll let you for me.

567
00:43:50,936 --> 00:43:54,716
And again, he used to hope so.

568
00:44:34,746 --> 00:44:40,886
While you've been out conducting your own
personal field operation, the entity has

569
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:47,186
infiltrated the nuclear command centers of
India, Israel, Pakistan and North Korea.

570
00:44:48,286 --> 00:44:55,367
Today at all four hundred hours of the time,
Francis Ramsey's facility was breached.

571
00:44:55,806 --> 00:45:00,926
And Tyre, nuclear arsenal is now under the
entity's command and control.

572
00:45:02,086 --> 00:45:05,926
That lives on the formations with secure
nuclear arsenals.

573
00:45:06,586 --> 00:45:09,106
UK, China, Russia and us.

574
00:45:13,796 --> 00:45:21,016
Everything you are, everything you've done
has come to this.

575
00:46:58,386 --> 00:47:01,786
The CIA black fault break in.

576
00:47:02,206 --> 00:47:04,606
I'm sorry, what is a knock list?

577
00:47:05,246 --> 00:47:08,046
A complete record of our covert operatives
overseas.

578
00:47:10,506 --> 00:47:12,866
So this is the man who
broke into our own black

579
00:47:12,867 --> 00:47:16,127
fault, who stole the
list of our own spies.

580
00:47:16,426 --> 00:47:17,426
Yes.

581
00:47:17,986 --> 00:47:19,686
He did return the list.

582
00:47:20,786 --> 00:47:21,786
It's on the next page.

583
00:47:22,646 --> 00:47:23,986
Am I reading this correctly?

584
00:47:24,706 --> 00:47:25,726
The criminal bombing?

585
00:47:27,026 --> 00:47:30,346
In fairness, the bomb was actually meant
to kill him.

586
00:47:31,286 --> 00:47:36,246
He gassed a security briefing at the
National Intelligence Journal.

587
00:47:36,886 --> 00:47:39,886
That was just two months ago.

588
00:47:41,506 --> 00:47:43,146
YouTube would have been in there.

589
00:47:44,226 --> 00:47:52,066
He arrived in the form of Mr. Kitridge's
aid and left as Mr. Kitridge, I believe.

590
00:47:53,326 --> 00:47:54,926
This explains the handcuffs.

591
00:47:55,926 --> 00:47:58,086
It's still not clear ways here,
like it or not.

592
00:47:58,126 --> 00:48:00,626
What we're looking at is our means of last
resort.

593
00:48:01,046 --> 00:48:03,606
Quite possibly our only hope of referring
nuclear Armageddon.

594
00:48:04,326 --> 00:48:09,146
If we want to control the entity,
we have to deal with him.

595
00:48:09,147 --> 00:48:12,326
Should we choose to accept?

596
00:48:23,546 --> 00:48:24,706
Agent Hunt.

597
00:48:25,526 --> 00:48:27,466
And I'm sorry for your loss.

598
00:48:35,266 --> 00:48:36,266
Please, sit.

599
00:48:48,236 --> 00:48:49,936
Let's hear it.

600
00:48:50,316 --> 00:48:53,076
I need that key in the use of a ship.

601
00:48:54,716 --> 00:48:59,556
Specifically in our craft carrier,
more specifically the George H.W.

602
00:48:59,796 --> 00:48:59,936
Bush.

603
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:06,756
He wants the use of a six and a half billion
dollar nuclear powered military asset.

604
00:49:07,096 --> 00:49:11,196
With instructions for the ships commanded
to accommodate my every request.

605
00:49:11,656 --> 00:49:12,696
To do what exactly?

606
00:49:13,616 --> 00:49:18,136
Use that key in what it opens to kill the
entity.

607
00:49:18,376 --> 00:49:21,516
Killing the entity means the annihilation
of cyberspace.

608
00:49:21,696 --> 00:49:23,696
The consequences of which are
catastrophic.

609
00:49:23,697 --> 00:49:24,796
Why the hell?

610
00:49:25,016 --> 00:49:25,516
What I do.

611
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:26,796
What you suggest.

612
00:49:27,216 --> 00:49:27,916
Especially matter president.

613
00:49:28,056 --> 00:49:28,856
You have no other choice.

614
00:49:29,036 --> 00:49:30,676
There is always another choice.

615
00:49:30,896 --> 00:49:31,176
Oh man.

616
00:49:31,316 --> 00:49:32,476
In this case, not a good one.

617
00:49:33,396 --> 00:49:34,592
It wants to move to your powers.

618
00:49:34,616 --> 00:49:36,256
You're going to paranoid downward spiral.

619
00:49:37,616 --> 00:49:40,176
Every nation had a chance to take their
missiles offline.

620
00:49:41,476 --> 00:49:43,256
Don't trust anyone else to do that.

621
00:49:44,136 --> 00:49:47,112
Your state department is warning you the
diplomatic chance of breaking down.

622
00:49:47,136 --> 00:49:50,216
Everyone who still has control their
arsenal is considering the first strike.

623
00:49:50,217 --> 00:49:51,276
Just like you are.

624
00:49:51,536 --> 00:49:54,476
The intelligence community knows that the
entity is learning as it goes.

625
00:49:54,696 --> 00:49:55,456
It's getting smarter.

626
00:49:55,676 --> 00:49:56,676
It's getting stronger.

627
00:49:56,916 --> 00:49:59,503
They know that we have only
72 hours before every other

628
00:49:59,504 --> 00:50:02,296
nuclear arsenal on earth
is under the entity's control.

629
00:50:02,696 --> 00:50:05,606
Three days before it focuses
a full force of its energy on

630
00:50:05,607 --> 00:50:08,596
the toughest or secure defense
system on the planet hours.

631
00:50:08,996 --> 00:50:11,084
At this point, the defense
department will have

632
00:50:11,085 --> 00:50:13,316
no choice but to insist
that you open that case.

633
00:50:13,317 --> 00:50:17,656
Enter the codes and launch an all-out
preemptive strike on the world's eight

634
00:50:17,657 --> 00:50:20,536
other nuclear arsenals before the entity
takes control of ours.

635
00:50:21,136 --> 00:50:21,636
Better president.

636
00:50:21,956 --> 00:50:23,956
Either you destroy the world or the entity
does.

637
00:50:24,376 --> 00:50:26,056
In any case, it is generated.

638
00:50:27,456 --> 00:50:28,916
There is another choice.

639
00:50:29,696 --> 00:50:31,720
You can tell me what
you know about that key

640
00:50:31,721 --> 00:50:33,676
and give us the power
to control the entity.

641
00:50:33,836 --> 00:50:34,236
Not a president.

642
00:50:34,636 --> 00:50:34,856
Exactly.

643
00:50:34,956 --> 00:50:36,116
That's what I would tell you.

644
00:50:36,356 --> 00:50:37,356
Everything I know.

645
00:50:37,476 --> 00:50:38,476
Everything.

646
00:50:38,556 --> 00:50:39,796
You ran the CIA.

647
00:50:40,096 --> 00:50:41,436
You know psychological warfare.

648
00:50:41,676 --> 00:50:43,696
What you see, it doesn't look around.

649
00:50:45,116 --> 00:50:46,936
We are in the entity's reality.

650
00:50:47,676 --> 00:50:49,856
And I believe it's counting on you to stop
me.

651
00:50:49,996 --> 00:50:52,848
If what you sign is true, how
can you be sure the entity

652
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:55,496
doesn't want us to do exactly
what you're proposing right now?

653
00:50:55,596 --> 00:50:57,150
Because it knows you
would never do anything so

654
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:59,936
illogical that you would
be insane to trust me.

655
00:51:00,196 --> 00:51:01,736
And that's precisely why you should.

656
00:51:02,136 --> 00:51:05,276
For once, let's let the entity worry about
what we're going to do.

657
00:51:05,277 --> 00:51:07,456
I'm worried about those three other
nations.

658
00:51:07,616 --> 00:51:10,096
Madam president is still in control of
their arsenal.

659
00:51:10,676 --> 00:51:15,296
Nations who could make and launch a
full-scale attack while he's out there

660
00:51:15,297 --> 00:51:18,076
with an aircraft carrier doing God knows
what?

661
00:51:18,077 --> 00:51:23,356
While he's out there trying to kill the
entity, which we all know is a terrible idea.

662
00:51:23,576 --> 00:51:24,576
My man, please.

663
00:51:24,636 --> 00:51:26,576
I'm asking for three days of you.

664
00:51:27,056 --> 00:51:28,376
Keep the world calm.

665
00:51:28,916 --> 00:51:31,036
Three days of heaven.

666
00:51:32,016 --> 00:51:32,816
Let you down before.

667
00:51:32,817 --> 00:51:35,496
And when the entity decides to attack
before them.

668
00:51:35,656 --> 00:51:37,636
It has enough missiles to kill buildings
already.

669
00:51:37,756 --> 00:51:38,516
Why hasn't it done?

670
00:51:38,616 --> 00:51:39,976
Because it's a machine.

671
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:41,876
It's thinking like a machine.

672
00:51:42,076 --> 00:51:42,516
Thinking.

673
00:51:43,096 --> 00:51:46,196
Thinking is dictated by what it's learned
from us.

674
00:51:46,316 --> 00:51:48,556
It hasn't launched because it doesn't have
total control.

675
00:51:48,616 --> 00:51:53,036
It needs the world's entire time of
arsenal to guarantee the desired outcome.

676
00:51:53,696 --> 00:51:55,636
A total evaluation of humankind.

677
00:51:56,776 --> 00:51:57,776
And a present.

678
00:51:58,116 --> 00:51:59,216
It is going to wait.

679
00:52:21,546 --> 00:52:26,207
Northward, including the Operation System
targeting central London has been breached.

680
00:52:26,426 --> 00:52:29,126
The United Kingdom has lost control of his
arsenal.

681
00:52:33,446 --> 00:52:36,266
I will ask you one last time.

682
00:52:37,046 --> 00:52:38,366
What does this all work?

683
00:52:39,446 --> 00:52:41,726
I need you to trust me.

684
00:52:42,666 --> 00:52:43,666
One last time.

685
00:52:43,766 --> 00:52:44,506
Trust me.

686
00:52:44,726 --> 00:52:45,726
I'll tell you.

687
00:52:46,286 --> 00:52:49,346
When that park runs out of 72 hours.

688
00:52:50,266 --> 00:52:54,486
I have a press that will invent your
responsibility.

689
00:52:55,766 --> 00:52:56,766
And a present.

690
00:52:57,226 --> 00:52:58,226
Sargence.

691
00:52:58,866 --> 00:52:59,866
Lock him up.

692
00:53:26,366 --> 00:53:28,206
You have 72 hours!

693
00:53:45,836 --> 00:53:46,836
I

694
00:54:03,146 --> 00:54:05,226
love your message on there.

695
00:54:05,986 --> 00:54:07,226
Your witness is over.

696
00:54:11,406 --> 00:54:12,906
You can tell me yourself.

697
00:54:14,926 --> 00:54:15,926
After?

698
00:54:17,526 --> 00:54:21,006
They made us thinking of when they gave us
the choice.

699
00:54:22,706 --> 00:54:24,906
We live and die the shadows.

700
00:54:26,326 --> 00:54:30,686
And as we hold close, I'm not a result of
whatever.

701
00:54:31,626 --> 00:54:33,486
I know it's on your mind.

702
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:38,046
You did the right thing when you kept
picking.

703
00:54:39,606 --> 00:54:42,246
You've always been on the right side,
brother.

704
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:44,046
Always.

705
00:54:45,286 --> 00:54:51,146
Never forget our lives are not defined by
anyone action.

706
00:54:52,846 --> 00:54:56,246
Our lives are the sum of our choices.

707
00:54:57,346 --> 00:54:59,026
I have no regrets.

708
00:55:00,746 --> 00:55:02,246
And these are should you.

709
00:56:30,516 --> 00:56:36,216
Did Erika did the president tell you the
meaning behind this note?

710
00:56:36,456 --> 00:56:37,656
No, no.

711
00:56:37,676 --> 00:56:43,096
Serbia, 22nd 1996, we lost someone we
loved very much.

712
00:56:44,076 --> 00:56:46,856
All because of no one in authority would
take a risk.

713
00:56:48,896 --> 00:56:50,536
I'm sitting on a pug of chemistry.

714
00:56:51,496 --> 00:56:55,836
Just over that horizon is Russia's only
aircraft carrier, the animal dispenser.

715
00:56:56,896 --> 00:56:59,038
I have one wrong
move away from the first

716
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:02,096
shootout between two
flat-tops and four-door two.

717
00:57:03,256 --> 00:57:06,036
One flinch from touching off World War
III.

718
00:57:07,796 --> 00:57:11,536
And you're asking me to fly directly into
the eye of the storm?

719
00:57:11,656 --> 00:57:12,656
Yes, ma'am.

720
00:57:14,976 --> 00:57:17,256
What exactly are you looking for?

721
00:57:18,396 --> 00:57:21,516
So, sir, short-for-sound surveillance
system.

722
00:57:21,876 --> 00:57:25,356
It's a worldwide network of undersea
acoustic cables dating back to the Cold War.

723
00:57:25,596 --> 00:57:28,636
If an undersea event of any significant
happens anywhere in the world,

724
00:57:28,856 --> 00:57:32,576
one of these listening stations will
pinpoint that event to the square metre.

725
00:57:32,577 --> 00:57:36,296
One of these sources stations will have
accorded our missing Russian submarines

726
00:57:36,297 --> 00:57:39,522
impact on the sea floor in
the winter of 2012, without

727
00:57:39,523 --> 00:57:42,116
ever understanding the
significance of the event.

728
00:57:42,336 --> 00:57:44,676
Where's the Russians know when this
festival vanished?

729
00:57:45,136 --> 00:57:46,656
They're just not exactly sure where.

730
00:57:46,976 --> 00:57:47,996
Well, did I finish one?

731
00:57:48,516 --> 00:57:49,516
Wait, Sissa.

732
00:57:50,476 --> 00:57:51,476
Which one?

733
00:57:51,996 --> 00:57:55,116
Out of all these sources stations,
picked up the event.

734
00:57:55,616 --> 00:57:59,776
We know the bodies of the Sustable's crew
were covered in CX, and since they were

735
00:57:59,777 --> 00:58:03,596
covered by Inuit fishermen, we're guessing
it went down somewhere in the Arctic.

736
00:58:04,056 --> 00:58:08,516
A search area of roughly five and a half
million square miles, meaning the most

737
00:58:08,517 --> 00:58:12,236
likely so-so station to pick it up is this
one.

738
00:58:12,256 --> 00:58:13,736
And the bearings see it.

739
00:58:13,936 --> 00:58:15,096
They met you at it.

740
00:58:16,636 --> 00:58:17,836
The Russians don't know this.

741
00:58:18,436 --> 00:58:20,292
Why haven't they just stolen the island
already?

742
00:58:20,316 --> 00:58:21,572
At the same time, Matthew was a U.S.

743
00:58:21,596 --> 00:58:23,987
government installation,
and over at the end

744
00:58:23,988 --> 00:58:25,896
of aggression with
trigger wood or three.

745
00:58:26,056 --> 00:58:28,076
But now, I'm not getting this coming.

746
00:58:28,516 --> 00:58:30,016
But here, who's nowhere in a battle?

747
00:58:30,017 --> 00:58:34,496
Do your friends and other walking into a
potential situation?

748
00:58:34,696 --> 00:58:35,996
They knew you used to the job.

749
00:58:36,976 --> 00:58:40,235
So to retrieve the entity
source code from Sustable,

750
00:58:40,236 --> 00:58:43,476
means the precise coordinates
from, say, Matthew I didn't.

751
00:58:43,776 --> 00:58:45,016
And a submarine, obviously.

752
00:58:45,496 --> 00:58:47,916
One that's willing to take you where you
want to go.

753
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:49,596
No questions asked.

754
00:58:50,936 --> 00:58:54,636
And that's assuming your friends can
actually get the coordinates.

755
00:58:54,956 --> 00:58:59,156
Which respect did you transmit for 15
minutes every two hours?

756
00:58:59,157 --> 00:59:03,456
In the hope that Ethan is somehow able to
receive a signal.

757
00:59:03,536 --> 00:59:05,736
How do you intend to make it out from
under the ISCA?

758
00:59:07,116 --> 00:59:10,076
I've turned 70-record into my 10-minute
video.

759
00:59:10,736 --> 00:59:13,448
Ethan will have a VHF
transmitter, which will enable

760
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:15,976
us to zero in on his exact
location under the ISCA.

761
00:59:16,316 --> 00:59:17,316
And we have to do that.

762
00:59:17,536 --> 00:59:18,536
He's grab a chainsaw.

763
00:59:18,836 --> 00:59:19,176
What?

764
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:22,496
Cut a hole in the ISCA and just pull Ethan
out.

765
00:59:22,696 --> 00:59:23,256
Hang on.

766
00:59:23,596 --> 00:59:26,296
Depending on how deep that
record, Ethan will have severe

767
00:59:26,297 --> 00:59:28,516
decompression signals
before he reaches the surface.

768
00:59:28,517 --> 00:59:31,156
Which is why we have this.

769
00:59:32,216 --> 00:59:34,456
What the hell is that?

770
00:59:34,576 --> 00:59:39,056
This is a state-of-the-art inflatable
hyperbaric decompression chamber.

771
00:59:39,956 --> 00:59:40,956
You're not serious.

772
00:59:43,936 --> 00:59:44,356
Oh.

773
00:59:44,676 --> 00:59:50,556
You mean to tell me that Ethan's life,
the fate of all life on earth depends on

774
00:59:50,557 --> 00:59:54,844
us all meeting at the
exact same place, at the

775
00:59:54,845 --> 00:59:59,476
exact same time, somewhere
in the frozen baring sea.

776
01:00:00,436 --> 01:00:01,436
With that.

777
01:00:01,996 --> 01:00:02,096
Exactly.

778
01:00:02,496 --> 01:00:04,996
And what if he drowns before we get there?

779
01:00:05,336 --> 01:00:06,336
It won't likely hurt.

780
01:00:06,376 --> 01:00:07,376
He will.

781
01:00:07,856 --> 01:00:11,035
But in water that cold, the
hyperthermia will slow down

782
01:00:11,036 --> 01:00:14,996
his metabolic functions
and by his time to revive him.

783
01:00:15,456 --> 01:00:17,796
That's your plan.

784
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:18,756
Exactly.

785
01:00:19,676 --> 01:00:21,076
That's a plan.

786
01:00:25,906 --> 01:00:28,026
The only submarine in range is the Ohio.

787
01:00:28,926 --> 01:00:30,366
Check Bloods houseboat.

788
01:00:30,806 --> 01:00:33,846
Once emerged, he's reachable only by Viala
Radio.

789
01:00:34,486 --> 01:00:36,326
She lived for many digital transmission.

790
01:00:36,746 --> 01:00:38,846
That means he's immune to this.

791
01:00:39,866 --> 01:00:41,266
But only if he's just rushed.

792
01:00:42,186 --> 01:00:45,346
And as we can get you there in two hours,
but it won't have enough fuel to wait.

793
01:00:45,966 --> 01:00:46,966
She's not as a choice.

794
01:00:47,126 --> 01:00:52,486
If the blood so receives my command,
if he believes it to be authentic,

795
01:00:53,006 --> 01:00:54,806
he might come to air-scope depths.

796
01:00:55,806 --> 01:00:57,906
He might wait 30 seconds.

797
01:00:57,907 --> 01:01:03,026
If you are even one minute late,
just give me this chance.

798
01:01:41,256 --> 01:01:42,596
That's what I said.

799
01:01:43,196 --> 01:01:44,196
With the key.

800
01:01:44,316 --> 01:01:45,816
Well, it couldn't do much without it.

801
01:01:46,616 --> 01:01:49,256
Somewhere in the northern Pacific I
assume.

802
01:01:49,776 --> 01:01:52,476
You gave him an aircraft carrier.

803
01:01:52,596 --> 01:01:55,716
I'm the commander-in-chief of the armed
forces, Mr. Secretary.

804
01:01:56,536 --> 01:01:58,156
It is my aircraft carrier.

805
01:01:58,676 --> 01:02:00,276
And I do with it as I please.

806
01:02:00,576 --> 01:02:01,936
You knew this would happen.

807
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:05,096
I suspected you could have heard those
told us.

808
01:02:05,116 --> 01:02:06,236
I just did.

809
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:07,456
And now you're excused.

810
01:02:07,496 --> 01:02:08,276
Madam President.

811
01:02:08,396 --> 01:02:09,476
That would be all.

812
01:02:25,636 --> 01:02:27,076
I couldn't tell you.

813
01:02:28,036 --> 01:02:30,736
It had to be my responsibility in mind
alone.

814
01:02:31,056 --> 01:02:32,716
And I had to buy home to time.

815
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:35,116
Someone could have tried to stop him.

816
01:02:35,416 --> 01:02:37,816
I may not agree with you, but they do
respect your authority.

817
01:02:38,596 --> 01:02:39,756
Before this is over.

818
01:02:39,816 --> 01:02:40,816
Someone will panic.

819
01:02:41,556 --> 01:02:43,636
Someone will try to stop me.

820
01:02:52,566 --> 01:02:54,286
Another fuel truck.

821
01:02:55,726 --> 01:02:56,726
You know where he's at?

822
01:02:56,866 --> 01:02:58,406
He knows where he's going to end up.

823
01:02:59,306 --> 01:03:00,306
That's surprising.

824
01:03:26,116 --> 01:03:29,202
This is the CIA station run
by seasoned field agents

825
01:03:29,203 --> 01:03:32,796
trained to get information
and never ever give it.

826
01:03:33,636 --> 01:03:35,976
Tell him nothing about our real mission.

827
01:03:36,236 --> 01:03:37,516
He's got anything to talk about.

828
01:03:42,536 --> 01:03:43,536
He's silly.

829
01:04:00,276 --> 01:04:01,276
Hello.

830
01:04:02,816 --> 01:04:04,176
Can I help you?

831
01:04:04,316 --> 01:04:05,376
I certainly hope so.

832
01:04:05,696 --> 01:04:08,396
Yes, we're looking for the sources
listening station.

833
01:04:08,596 --> 01:04:09,596
You found it, friend.

834
01:04:09,776 --> 01:04:10,556
I'm a station chief.

835
01:04:10,716 --> 01:04:12,876
You'll download my wife to be sent.

836
01:04:14,776 --> 01:04:15,036
Hello.

837
01:04:15,656 --> 01:04:16,656
How do you do?

838
01:04:17,136 --> 01:04:18,256
Nice to meet you, though.

839
01:04:19,076 --> 01:04:20,636
There were searches for the British
seismologist.

840
01:04:20,656 --> 01:04:22,216
Sorry, did you say Don Long?

841
01:04:22,436 --> 01:04:23,436
That's right.

842
01:04:24,176 --> 01:04:25,176
William Don Long.

843
01:04:25,596 --> 01:04:26,516
Langley Don Long.

844
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:27,676
Black Vault Don Long.

845
01:04:28,216 --> 01:04:29,216
At the same.

846
01:04:29,656 --> 01:04:30,436
And you are.

847
01:04:30,676 --> 01:04:31,816
I don't believe.

848
01:04:33,656 --> 01:04:35,496
This guy is a coding legend.

849
01:04:36,216 --> 01:04:37,856
He designed the CIA mainframe of Langley.

850
01:04:38,156 --> 01:04:40,536
The black vault is the most secure
database on the planet.

851
01:04:40,696 --> 01:04:41,732
It's completely dependable.

852
01:04:41,756 --> 01:04:44,616
Well, if it were impenetrable,
I wouldn't be here.

853
01:04:44,617 --> 01:04:49,736
The vault was breached in 96, and the
agencies should be on the same day.

854
01:04:50,076 --> 01:04:51,076
And here ever since.

855
01:04:52,276 --> 01:04:58,336
So you mean to say you've been on this
island for 30 years.

856
01:04:59,936 --> 01:05:00,996
Just got a curiosity.

857
01:05:01,496 --> 01:05:03,016
How do you know about the black vault?

858
01:05:03,896 --> 01:05:05,896
That's how the class of life.

859
01:05:08,216 --> 01:05:09,216
Sorry.

860
01:05:09,416 --> 01:05:10,496
Who did you say you were?

861
01:05:10,536 --> 01:05:12,316
Just tell the man while we're here.

862
01:05:12,317 --> 01:05:14,514
Mr. Don Longville,
even if we could tell you

863
01:05:14,515 --> 01:05:16,516
the truth, you wouldn't
believe that I wouldn't.

864
01:05:16,656 --> 01:05:16,836
Great.

865
01:05:16,936 --> 01:05:18,586
The heart of the matter
is that we need access

866
01:05:18,587 --> 01:05:21,177
to all your social status
from late winter 2012.

867
01:05:21,516 --> 01:05:23,876
Otherwise, the world will cease to exist
in a few days.

868
01:05:25,996 --> 01:05:27,696
It's happening, isn't it?

869
01:05:29,096 --> 01:05:30,096
The entity.

870
01:05:31,776 --> 01:05:36,776
I tried to warn people about it for years,
but no one would listen.

871
01:05:38,296 --> 01:05:39,356
Can you help us?

872
01:05:40,096 --> 01:05:42,356
I wish I could.

873
01:06:01,046 --> 01:06:02,086
Come in.

874
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:04,686
Make yourself comfortable.

875
01:06:11,256 --> 01:06:12,256
Wake up, sir.

876
01:06:12,776 --> 01:06:13,776
We got problems.

877
01:06:14,216 --> 01:06:15,216
We got problems.

878
01:06:16,436 --> 01:06:17,436
What's happening?

879
01:06:17,616 --> 01:06:18,916
At the end of our business side.

880
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:22,156
We got to get out of here.

881
01:06:22,396 --> 01:06:24,016
We're in our distress zone, man.

882
01:06:27,906 --> 01:06:30,206
We want to be able to get us back to the
building.

883
01:06:30,446 --> 01:06:31,086
Maybe you have a radio.

884
01:06:31,366 --> 01:06:32,606
Nothing but static on BHF.

885
01:06:32,686 --> 01:06:34,266
Your friends are broadcasting a signal.

886
01:06:34,506 --> 01:06:35,126
We can't hear it.

887
01:06:35,266 --> 01:06:35,746
Thank you, sir.

888
01:06:35,906 --> 01:06:36,226
You're in your harbor.

889
01:06:36,646 --> 01:06:37,446
We're at Bingo.

890
01:06:37,466 --> 01:06:38,026
Bye, bitch.

891
01:06:38,306 --> 01:06:39,306
Mr. Biff.

892
01:06:39,646 --> 01:06:40,646
Please.

893
01:06:43,546 --> 01:06:45,046
We can give you one.

894
01:06:45,406 --> 01:06:46,406
Please now.

895
01:09:01,206 --> 01:09:03,146
You must be captured by that, sir.

896
01:09:03,646 --> 01:09:06,626
And you must be out of your mind.

897
01:09:07,866 --> 01:09:10,846
What exactly was the plan, if we hadn't
shown that?

898
01:09:11,326 --> 01:09:11,906
You know?

899
01:09:11,946 --> 01:09:13,886
I really hadn't thought that far ahead.

900
01:09:17,626 --> 01:09:18,626
You know?

901
01:09:23,056 --> 01:09:25,256
You're at Long daily, since you're
regards.

902
01:09:26,256 --> 01:09:28,296
She told me to expect a green flare.

903
01:09:30,576 --> 01:09:31,956
She never mentioned the taser.

904
01:09:32,296 --> 01:09:34,076
Mind telling me what this is all about.

905
01:09:34,356 --> 01:09:35,477
I'm missing this classified.

906
01:09:36,836 --> 01:09:38,716
I need you to take me north.

907
01:09:38,717 --> 01:09:39,717
Continue.

908
01:09:39,936 --> 01:09:41,776
I'm expecting a set of exact coordinates.

909
01:09:41,956 --> 01:09:43,236
We have more scope transmission.

910
01:09:43,376 --> 01:09:46,816
And just how exactly do you expect to
receive them down here?

911
01:09:47,556 --> 01:09:49,096
You have to come in first-code death.

912
01:09:50,196 --> 01:09:51,196
Raise the antenna.

913
01:09:51,676 --> 01:09:52,296
Signal scandal.

914
01:09:52,596 --> 01:09:54,096
We'll either do the EHF bed.

915
01:09:54,936 --> 01:09:55,936
Or how long?

916
01:09:56,116 --> 01:09:57,116
15 minutes.

917
01:09:57,436 --> 01:10:00,736
It would give the Russians 15 minutes to
pinpoint our location.

918
01:10:01,696 --> 01:10:05,136
Starting at noon every two hours after
that.

919
01:10:05,456 --> 01:10:08,016
Until my team sends me those coordinates.

920
01:10:12,456 --> 01:10:15,116
North is the bearing
seat, Mr. Right now every

921
01:10:15,117 --> 01:10:18,096
submarine in the Russian
Pacific fleet is up there.

922
01:10:18,476 --> 01:10:22,957
My primary mission is to lock down their
positions and ascertain what they're up to.

923
01:10:23,036 --> 01:10:24,436
I'm thinking you know the answer.

924
01:10:27,096 --> 01:10:27,556
Yes, Jack.

925
01:10:28,096 --> 01:10:29,136
That's St. Matthew Island.

926
01:10:29,616 --> 01:10:32,016
There's nothing there but an old source of
listening station.

927
01:10:33,016 --> 01:10:34,016
That right next to me.

928
01:10:34,056 --> 01:10:35,056
What is that?

929
01:10:38,566 --> 01:10:39,566
That's a little sharic.

930
01:10:40,826 --> 01:10:41,826
You know what that is.

931
01:10:43,066 --> 01:10:45,406
It's many sure Russian special forces.

932
01:10:45,946 --> 01:10:48,766
Get yourself a gold star,
Mr. Area Recon spotted

933
01:10:48,767 --> 01:10:51,886
an off-sync Matthew
Island just over an hour ago.

934
01:10:52,186 --> 01:10:53,706
It's deployed from this.

935
01:10:54,506 --> 01:10:55,506
The bug arrived.

936
01:10:55,886 --> 01:10:57,646
The deadly submarine in the Russian Navy.

937
01:10:58,466 --> 01:11:01,766
My secondary mission is to locate that
bastard and hold it at risk.

938
01:11:02,346 --> 01:11:04,426
The lestjaric means it's somewhere close
by.

939
01:11:07,126 --> 01:11:09,046
You have people on that island.

940
01:11:10,046 --> 01:11:11,846
That's where your coordinates are coming
from.

941
01:11:14,446 --> 01:11:16,406
Well, you help me.

942
01:11:16,806 --> 01:11:22,026
Mr. If you want to build the bear.

943
01:11:23,746 --> 01:11:26,966
Oh, you've come to the right man.

944
01:11:28,366 --> 01:11:30,466
Like speakers here, Dave, Mr. Sir.

945
01:11:32,266 --> 01:11:32,926
Yes, sir.

946
01:11:33,266 --> 01:11:35,646
That builds me in our guests in the four
common quarters.

947
01:11:36,086 --> 01:11:36,366
Nice.

948
01:11:36,826 --> 01:11:37,826
This way, sir.

949
01:11:40,146 --> 01:11:44,146
As I've explained to our friends here,
I don't have the data they want.

950
01:11:44,386 --> 01:11:47,906
The agency ignored my request to upgrade
our system for a decade.

951
01:11:48,666 --> 01:11:51,137
One day, a team shows
up unannounced and

952
01:11:51,138 --> 01:11:53,666
refixed the entire system
in a matter of days.

953
01:11:53,686 --> 01:11:55,666
I'm guessing this is the winter of 2012.

954
01:11:56,346 --> 01:12:00,426
And the old system ran on magnetic tapes
backed up to 8-inch flopies.

955
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:02,186
These were the dog set out back.

956
01:12:02,306 --> 01:12:06,466
And these boxes might contain the
coordinates you're all looking for.

957
01:12:06,467 --> 01:12:08,626
But, I don't have a reader.

958
01:12:09,106 --> 01:12:11,886
That was also taken away in 2012.

959
01:12:12,706 --> 01:12:14,246
You expected to build one.

960
01:12:14,426 --> 01:12:15,566
I came for coordinates.

961
01:12:16,386 --> 01:12:16,766
Not boxes.

962
01:12:17,206 --> 01:12:18,442
Supposing you find the coordinates.

963
01:12:18,466 --> 01:12:21,446
When I was to my team, we'll take the
coordinates to my superiors.

964
01:12:22,106 --> 01:12:23,246
My man weighs here.

965
01:12:23,366 --> 01:12:25,206
When we have located what we're looking
for.

966
01:12:25,466 --> 01:12:27,426
My man will leave and he will not be
harmed.

967
01:12:28,386 --> 01:12:29,926
Would you believe that if you were me?

968
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:31,886
No, I would not.

969
01:12:32,486 --> 01:12:34,326
You have one hour to build a drive.

970
01:12:37,366 --> 01:12:38,646
What's your name?

971
01:12:39,126 --> 01:12:39,906
Gabs off.

972
01:12:40,146 --> 01:12:41,146
Your first name?

973
01:12:41,486 --> 01:12:42,486
Captain.

974
01:12:43,046 --> 01:12:43,426
Cots off.

975
01:12:43,666 --> 01:12:44,106
I'm Grace.

976
01:12:44,646 --> 01:12:45,646
That's Benji.

977
01:12:45,686 --> 01:12:47,546
Could we just for five minutes be human
beings?

978
01:12:48,306 --> 01:12:49,506
Not Russians, not Americans.

979
01:12:50,126 --> 01:12:52,086
Just people that want to see our loved
ones again.

980
01:12:52,166 --> 01:12:53,446
I have no one.

981
01:12:53,866 --> 01:12:54,866
Another than a dog.

982
01:12:55,766 --> 01:12:57,686
Why are you sending you down half this
key?

983
01:12:58,846 --> 01:13:02,386
A cruciform key that grants the holder
access to the Podcova.

984
01:13:02,586 --> 01:13:04,734
Even if you have the
coordinates, you still can't safely

985
01:13:04,735 --> 01:13:08,726
retrieve the entity's source
code without our help.

986
01:13:09,666 --> 01:13:11,606
You have another key.

987
01:13:12,166 --> 01:13:13,166
Don't you?

988
01:13:14,506 --> 01:13:16,366
You've had one a little long.

989
01:13:16,706 --> 01:13:19,066
But you don't have other coordinates.

990
01:13:20,306 --> 01:13:24,366
And when you build a drive, we will have
that.

991
01:13:25,866 --> 01:13:27,186
Hey, let's try something else.

992
01:13:28,246 --> 01:13:30,506
What if I told you that we have a friend?

993
01:13:30,507 --> 01:13:34,666
Has been disavowed by his own government
because he refused to hand over this key.

994
01:13:35,206 --> 01:13:38,426
Our friend is out there right now,
independent from any chain of command,

995
01:13:38,626 --> 01:13:40,242
waiting for us to transmit those
coordinates.

996
01:13:40,266 --> 01:13:43,503
And he will stop at nothing
to safely retrieve the Podcova

997
01:13:43,504 --> 01:13:46,926
and use the source code
stored on it to destroy the entity.

998
01:13:47,046 --> 01:13:49,714
I love the sake of any one
nation, but for all, don't you

999
01:13:49,715 --> 01:13:53,286
see if the entity is counting
on us to distrust each other?

1000
01:13:53,766 --> 01:13:56,326
Please, let us complete our mission.

1001
01:13:57,226 --> 01:13:58,686
We are not enemies.

1002
01:13:59,606 --> 01:14:03,846
We should believe that, if you want me.

1003
01:14:09,206 --> 01:14:10,326
I suppose I wouldn't.

1004
01:14:11,206 --> 01:14:12,206
You'll have one hour.

1005
01:14:18,066 --> 01:14:22,106
This is a marked sudden pressure suit,
specifically designed to reduce

1006
01:14:22,107 --> 01:14:24,746
decompression time after diving for found
deaths.

1007
01:14:24,946 --> 01:14:28,926
It does this by means of an exotic mixture
of oxygen and inner gases.

1008
01:14:29,506 --> 01:14:32,186
You'll need to do an extended grief up for
your body to handle it.

1009
01:14:32,187 --> 01:14:34,226
Exactly what kind of gas is your reach out
about.

1010
01:14:34,366 --> 01:14:35,366
Nice classified.

1011
01:14:36,146 --> 01:14:39,079
Assuming you're on task for
20 minutes or less, your time

1012
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:43,346
in decompression will be
cut down from days to hours.

1013
01:14:44,946 --> 01:14:49,826
Theoretically, theoretically, we haven't
tested the mark 7 below 300 feet.

1014
01:14:50,766 --> 01:14:56,466
To conserve air, you'll need to make a
fast descent, which means guaranteed HPNS,

1015
01:14:57,226 --> 01:14:58,846
high pressure nervous syndrome.

1016
01:14:59,666 --> 01:15:07,107
You should expect tremors, shapes, dizziness,
disorientation, and mental confusion.

1017
01:15:07,666 --> 01:15:10,746
And all of it under extreme pressure.

1018
01:15:11,606 --> 01:15:14,318
Even if the mark 7 works
as designed, you still

1019
01:15:14,319 --> 01:15:17,267
won't have enough
mixture for a slow ascent.

1020
01:15:17,886 --> 01:15:20,266
That means you're guaranteed to get the
beds.

1021
01:15:21,506 --> 01:15:24,386
Magicing in your muscle tissue expands
into your bloodstream.

1022
01:15:26,006 --> 01:15:28,066
You screw your shitting pain.

1023
01:15:28,906 --> 01:15:29,906
Confulsions.

1024
01:15:30,906 --> 01:15:32,926
Sleep loss in muscle control.

1025
01:15:34,046 --> 01:15:37,326
You'll have maybe 20 minutes to get to the
decompression chamber.

1026
01:15:39,566 --> 01:15:40,566
What did that mean?

1027
01:15:41,346 --> 01:15:42,146
What did that mean?

1028
01:15:42,147 --> 01:15:43,926
It was at the decompression chamber.

1029
01:15:44,986 --> 01:15:46,566
You're dead now.

1030
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:51,266
Another VHF scan came and went.

1031
01:15:52,206 --> 01:15:55,786
If your friends are broadcasting,
we still haven't picked it up.

1032
01:16:12,076 --> 01:16:14,836
Come on, come on, come on, come on,
come on.

1033
01:16:21,496 --> 01:16:23,176
That's the sled dogs out in the bar.

1034
01:16:23,456 --> 01:16:25,056
It's coming at the dinner time.

1035
01:16:37,956 --> 01:16:39,556
A military or a military friend.

1036
01:16:40,416 --> 01:16:42,456
There are no coordinates on any of these
disks.

1037
01:16:44,356 --> 01:16:46,446
That refit 14 years ago.

1038
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:49,596
It had all the stench of a cover-up.

1039
01:16:51,596 --> 01:16:54,116
And the top man talked down to the piece.

1040
01:16:55,536 --> 01:16:57,256
I didn't like that.

1041
01:16:58,416 --> 01:17:00,336
I never told them about these backups.

1042
01:17:01,036 --> 01:17:04,036
And when they left, I went through every
one of them myself.

1043
01:17:04,476 --> 01:17:06,496
A lone event stood out.

1044
01:17:07,936 --> 01:17:09,756
A massive undersea implosion.

1045
01:17:10,016 --> 01:17:12,216
Not a month before they arrived to take
everything away.

1046
01:17:12,956 --> 01:17:14,916
Naturally, I didn't understand the
significance.

1047
01:17:14,917 --> 01:17:17,256
But I noted the coordinates.

1048
01:17:17,696 --> 01:17:20,416
And then I destroyed the only disk.

1049
01:17:22,576 --> 01:17:26,876
But you see, you know where the suffice to
fall is.

1050
01:17:28,056 --> 01:17:29,936
Down the square meter.

1051
01:17:42,136 --> 01:17:43,316
Dinner time.

1052
01:17:45,816 --> 01:17:48,516
Can my wife please tend to the dogs?

1053
01:17:49,056 --> 01:17:50,656
I can't concentrate with this record.

1054
01:18:05,316 --> 01:18:06,656
Who call my dignity?

1055
01:18:08,576 --> 01:18:09,576
Not legally.

1056
01:18:14,276 --> 01:18:16,976
I'm just going to help you.

1057
01:18:20,556 --> 01:18:22,056
She's gonna need some help.

1058
01:18:22,216 --> 01:18:23,216
Okay.

1059
01:18:25,076 --> 01:18:27,096
I can use the air.

1060
01:18:28,696 --> 01:18:30,016
Sign up for what I did, you shut.

1061
01:18:55,096 --> 01:18:57,456
Five minutes to the next broadcast window.

1062
01:18:58,616 --> 01:19:01,656
We'll be under the ice cap soon and lose
all comms.

1063
01:19:02,376 --> 01:19:06,296
This will be our last chance.

1064
01:20:01,936 --> 01:20:03,176
Chief of the Watch.

1065
01:20:03,177 --> 01:20:05,496
Raise number one comms at 10.

1066
01:20:22,716 --> 01:20:26,196
Wait, what is this?

1067
01:20:26,756 --> 01:20:28,316
What is this?

1068
01:20:28,516 --> 01:20:29,556
You won't stop the entity.

1069
01:20:31,536 --> 01:20:33,016
I can't let you.

1070
01:20:35,836 --> 01:20:37,396
What's this?

1071
01:21:10,376 --> 01:21:17,946
I don't get to the radio.

1072
01:21:48,406 --> 01:21:49,406
We

1073
01:21:52,286 --> 01:21:53,586
have yet more scotting time.

1074
01:21:53,966 --> 01:21:54,966
Radio and speaker.

1075
01:22:00,446 --> 01:22:14,186
We're gonna have a good day.

1076
01:22:21,126 --> 01:22:22,326
Hey, dark.

1077
01:22:22,786 --> 01:22:24,206
Is the too much?

1078
01:22:25,706 --> 01:22:26,706
Dark.

1079
01:22:27,186 --> 01:22:28,766
What's the end of that?

1080
01:25:02,266 --> 01:25:07,226
That's two thousand miles off the Cape of
Good Hope on the other side of the world.

1081
01:25:08,066 --> 01:25:10,806
Damn near exactly.

1082
01:25:15,006 --> 01:25:16,386
And that's right.

1083
01:25:26,766 --> 01:25:27,766
Exactly.

1084
01:25:27,926 --> 01:25:28,326
The opposite.

1085
01:25:28,886 --> 01:25:30,466
In case the Russians were listening.

1086
01:25:31,466 --> 01:25:32,466
There we go.

1087
01:25:33,666 --> 01:25:35,846
Officer of the deck, set a new course.

1088
01:25:36,066 --> 01:25:37,506
340, right 15 degrees.

1089
01:25:37,606 --> 01:25:38,866
Runner, steady, of course, 340.

1090
01:25:39,046 --> 01:25:40,326
I saw my letter was right 15.

1091
01:25:40,626 --> 01:25:41,626
Officer of the deck.

1092
01:25:41,806 --> 01:25:44,166
Submer its contact, varying one,
zero, zero.

1093
01:25:44,466 --> 01:25:45,986
On the edge of our star of baffles.

1094
01:25:45,987 --> 01:25:46,486
You're good?

1095
01:25:46,766 --> 01:25:47,326
The exhibiting tolls.

1096
01:25:47,446 --> 01:25:49,802
The progression that's here to cast up,
we're really new to watch.

1097
01:25:49,826 --> 01:25:51,946
Station the fire control track and party
side.

1098
01:25:52,186 --> 01:25:54,446
Inside the ice server, those one must have
accomplished.

1099
01:25:54,966 --> 01:25:56,246
We found the belt around.

1100
01:25:56,506 --> 01:25:57,506
It's a rudder-nirus.

1101
01:25:58,166 --> 01:25:59,766
Every emergency was taking you.

1102
01:26:01,006 --> 01:26:03,406
Now you're taking the Russians there.

1103
01:26:05,026 --> 01:26:06,586
And the burning of my destination.

1104
01:26:07,346 --> 01:26:11,366
All the reasons for crewmen, so like if
it's with ten knots, turn this boat around

1105
01:26:11,367 --> 01:26:14,146
and take the Russians back the way we
came.

1106
01:26:14,686 --> 01:26:15,966
I haven't seen your mission there.

1107
01:26:15,967 --> 01:26:20,706
I'll be getting off the turn.

1108
01:26:20,726 --> 01:26:26,166
Mr. I thought I'd take a person chamber
you'll die for sure.

1109
01:26:26,526 --> 01:26:27,526
Sure.

1110
01:26:27,626 --> 01:26:31,946
Your decompression chamber was never part
of our plan.

1111
01:26:36,046 --> 01:26:37,046
Okay.

1112
01:26:39,506 --> 01:26:43,326
What exactly is your plan?

1113
01:26:56,506 --> 01:26:57,506
Okay.

1114
01:27:04,576 --> 01:27:06,236
Give me a hand.

1115
01:27:22,196 --> 01:27:23,196
If it did.

1116
01:27:25,196 --> 01:27:25,916
No?

1117
01:27:26,116 --> 01:27:27,536
No, no, no, no, no... I can't.

1118
01:27:27,537 --> 01:27:28,816
I don't have a plan anymore.

1119
01:27:29,696 --> 01:27:33,076
Of course.

1120
01:27:38,486 --> 01:27:39,486
Of course.

1121
01:28:01,346 --> 01:28:05,186
This should be.

1122
01:28:12,046 --> 01:28:13,326
What's this for?

1123
01:28:16,606 --> 01:28:16,886
What?

1124
01:28:16,887 --> 01:28:20,086
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1125
01:28:22,726 --> 01:28:25,766
Hold back.

1126
01:28:26,726 --> 01:28:27,886
Take a moving.

1127
01:28:35,606 --> 01:28:37,206
Are you mean after day?

1128
01:29:06,756 --> 01:29:10,036
Take a deep breath.

1129
01:29:10,216 --> 01:29:13,616
Mark 7's guidance system will take you to
your coordinates.

1130
01:29:14,056 --> 01:29:17,036
The debt to your location is 500 feet.

1131
01:29:17,356 --> 01:29:20,676
Figure 19 minutes to your target 10
minutes on task.

1132
01:29:20,976 --> 01:29:26,656
Remember any longer than that in your
chances of survival decrease by the second.

1133
01:29:26,657 --> 01:29:31,196
And don't forget, you must exhale
continuously as you rise to the surface.

1134
01:29:31,596 --> 01:29:33,876
Hold your breath and your lungs will
explode.

1135
01:29:34,596 --> 01:29:36,596
The VHF transmitted us for.

1136
01:29:36,796 --> 01:29:39,896
Your team should be able to locate you
within a two-mile radius.

1137
01:29:40,996 --> 01:29:41,996
Look after that.

1138
01:29:44,016 --> 01:29:45,016
Good luck.

1139
01:29:54,446 --> 01:29:56,426
Take care of my suit.

1140
01:30:15,426 --> 01:30:20,026
Sir, I have near-field effect too close to
tell.

1141
01:30:20,386 --> 01:30:21,026
The new hurrying.

1142
01:30:21,106 --> 01:30:22,506
Slow to 10 knots by log.

1143
01:30:23,046 --> 01:30:24,686
Helm on my mark right full rudder.

1144
01:30:24,806 --> 01:30:26,166
Stand in by for your more captain.

1145
01:31:25,886 --> 01:31:26,706
The turn.

1146
01:31:26,766 --> 01:31:28,346
I'm sir, my rudder is right full.

1147
01:36:02,476 --> 01:36:40,486
The turn.

1148
01:36:44,066 --> 01:36:45,546
I'm sir, my rudder is right full.

1149
01:39:51,146 --> 01:39:52,146
I'm on the way!

1150
01:49:46,686 --> 01:49:47,686
What are you saying?

1151
01:49:48,786 --> 01:49:55,446
I'm in the back
of my You did it.

1152
01:49:56,346 --> 01:49:58,826
You did it.

1153
01:50:01,706 --> 01:50:03,846
So loud it's gone.

1154
01:50:07,156 --> 01:50:08,156
But how many?

1155
01:50:08,936 --> 01:50:10,196
I can't real.

1156
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:13,616
I can't do this.

1157
01:50:13,716 --> 01:50:16,276
We can't do this, but we can't.

1158
01:50:16,277 --> 01:50:17,296
We can't real.

1159
01:50:17,356 --> 01:50:18,356
We can't real, did you?

1160
01:50:19,716 --> 01:50:20,996
Yeah, man, you're thinking.

1161
01:50:22,816 --> 01:50:25,396
How could we not do this against you,
start?

1162
01:50:26,216 --> 01:50:33,836
If we can control it, maybe we should
break the want of the break.

1163
01:50:34,536 --> 01:50:35,536
Praise.

1164
01:50:36,956 --> 01:50:40,976
All that earth, was you ever trust with
that much power?

1165
01:50:41,676 --> 01:50:43,156
Will you, of course?

1166
01:50:44,736 --> 01:50:45,736
I hate you.

1167
01:50:47,316 --> 01:50:49,056
I believe you are meant to do this.

1168
01:50:50,616 --> 01:50:51,616
That's right.

1169
01:50:52,776 --> 01:50:53,776
Not anyone.

1170
01:51:03,986 --> 01:51:06,606
You're breaking me, man.

1171
01:51:07,286 --> 01:51:10,986
I think so.

1172
01:51:21,166 --> 01:51:23,066
See you in the story.

1173
01:51:53,226 --> 01:51:55,606
We haven't been formally introduced.

1174
01:51:56,346 --> 01:51:58,166
I'm way down low, mainly.

1175
01:51:59,466 --> 01:52:00,546
About 30 years ago.

1176
01:52:01,646 --> 01:52:02,646
Almost.

1177
01:52:08,226 --> 01:52:09,886
So you and him.

1178
01:52:10,466 --> 01:52:12,746
I understand how you're in my life.

1179
01:52:14,806 --> 01:52:16,046
I know how to make men's food.

1180
01:52:16,306 --> 01:52:17,306
I've done yours.

1181
01:52:17,566 --> 01:52:19,746
That's a matter of perspective,
friend.

1182
01:52:21,106 --> 01:52:24,866
If you hadn't broken the vault 30 years
ago, I probably still be there.

1183
01:52:25,966 --> 01:52:27,526
I probably don't think I was happening.

1184
01:52:28,206 --> 01:52:31,946
I never would have found the only home
that's ever brought me in peace.

1185
01:52:32,686 --> 01:52:35,066
And I certainly never would have met the
woman I love.

1186
01:52:42,146 --> 01:52:44,226
There's nothing to be sorry about.

1187
01:52:47,806 --> 01:52:49,326
I owe you my life.

1188
01:52:59,826 --> 01:53:01,646
It'll be landing just as the clock runs
out.

1189
01:53:01,786 --> 01:53:05,226
By the time we arrive, the entity will
have control of the world's nine automated

1190
01:53:05,227 --> 01:53:08,146
doomsday arsenals, and it will be fueling
the missiles and controls.

1191
01:53:08,966 --> 01:53:11,546
But it can't launch until it has a safe
place to hide.

1192
01:53:11,826 --> 01:53:12,826
If it wants to survive.

1193
01:53:13,046 --> 01:53:14,806
The safest place is here.

1194
01:53:14,966 --> 01:53:15,626
What is that?

1195
01:53:15,826 --> 01:53:17,046
The doomsday fault.

1196
01:53:17,686 --> 01:53:18,306
How go you are?

1197
01:53:18,506 --> 01:53:21,346
It's a top secret standalone solar power.

1198
01:53:21,347 --> 01:53:25,166
Tempest hardened level A X abide data
server.

1199
01:53:25,626 --> 01:53:27,386
One billion gigabytes of storage.

1200
01:53:27,626 --> 01:53:29,826
So our home movies are far off.

1201
01:53:30,066 --> 01:53:33,026
It contains all the accumulated knowledge
deemed worthy of preservation.

1202
01:53:33,566 --> 01:53:34,566
And it's fully sealed.

1203
01:53:34,906 --> 01:53:37,306
Totally impervious to electromagnetic
energy of any kind.

1204
01:53:37,366 --> 01:53:38,686
No transmissions in our eyes.

1205
01:53:38,986 --> 01:53:42,566
An imperruptible art of human history
built to survive the ending of the world.

1206
01:53:42,886 --> 01:53:47,366
So if the entity got in there,
it could survive thousands of years,

1207
01:53:47,506 --> 01:53:49,402
no matter what happened to the rest of the
world.

1208
01:53:49,426 --> 01:53:50,446
What do you want to survive?

1209
01:53:50,447 --> 01:53:53,506
What does it stand the game from wiping
out all life on earth?

1210
01:53:53,766 --> 01:53:57,346
A question Noah and his family must have
asked just before the flag.

1211
01:53:57,726 --> 01:54:00,166
The entity got things as God.

1212
01:54:00,167 --> 01:54:01,167
Come on, Chief.

1213
01:54:01,406 --> 01:54:04,386
Always right to the point, aren't you?

1214
01:54:04,686 --> 01:54:08,066
This is the poison pill containing the
earth as algorithm.

1215
01:54:09,366 --> 01:54:13,386
And this is the part cover containing the
entity's original source code.

1216
01:54:13,626 --> 01:54:16,926
When combined, they will form a sort of
digital toxin.

1217
01:54:17,246 --> 01:54:19,760
When uploaded to
cyberspace, this toxin will attack

1218
01:54:19,761 --> 01:54:22,446
the entity and alter its
ability to perceive reality.

1219
01:54:22,926 --> 01:54:27,546
So combine that with the part cover,
we could deceive the Lord of lies.

1220
01:54:29,946 --> 01:54:32,546
May, get to your own name.

1221
01:54:32,706 --> 01:54:35,726
May, we don't have Luther's poison pill.

1222
01:54:36,046 --> 01:54:40,126
Gabriel does, which is why we can be sure
to be waiting for us in the doomsday form.

1223
01:54:40,406 --> 01:54:44,486
Once the entity is infected with Luther's
algorithm, it will think it's entering the

1224
01:54:44,487 --> 01:54:49,046
junction central data server when it will
actually be going here.

1225
01:54:49,047 --> 01:54:50,566
What is it?

1226
01:54:50,766 --> 01:54:52,246
Careful, it's very delicate.

1227
01:54:53,086 --> 01:54:54,606
It can't be.

1228
01:54:55,366 --> 01:54:58,546
It's a 5D optical data drive.

1229
01:54:59,186 --> 01:55:01,046
360 terabytes in the palm of your eye.

1230
01:55:01,246 --> 01:55:02,766
I thought these were just theoretical.

1231
01:55:03,006 --> 01:55:04,006
They were.

1232
01:55:04,466 --> 01:55:05,706
I definitely felt one.

1233
01:55:10,966 --> 01:55:13,638
If the entity is our
genie, then this optical

1234
01:55:13,639 --> 01:55:17,026
drive is the bottle
we'll capture it in.

1235
01:55:17,726 --> 01:55:19,526
Which brings us to the truth part.

1236
01:55:20,066 --> 01:55:22,622
Once inside, once it
believes that it's safe,

1237
01:55:22,623 --> 01:55:25,927
the entity will initiate
a nuclear launch.

1238
01:55:26,526 --> 01:55:29,106
We have to disconnect this drive before it
can do that.

1239
01:55:29,206 --> 01:55:30,206
How long do we have?

1240
01:55:31,366 --> 01:55:31,846
Roughly?

1241
01:55:32,086 --> 01:55:35,026
100 milliseconds to thank you for now.

1242
01:55:35,986 --> 01:55:39,206
If you do it too soon, we won't trap the
genie in the bar.

1243
01:55:39,207 --> 01:55:40,666
If you do it too late.

1244
01:55:41,106 --> 01:55:42,786
We won't prevent the entity from
launching.

1245
01:55:43,506 --> 01:55:43,586
Yeah.

1246
01:55:43,746 --> 01:55:44,746
Either way.

1247
01:55:44,966 --> 01:55:48,146
If we pull the drive at the wrong time,
the entity wins.

1248
01:55:48,626 --> 01:55:49,626
Don't show us.

1249
01:55:50,246 --> 01:55:50,786
How long?

1250
01:55:50,787 --> 01:55:52,769
If the doomsday
vault is electronically

1251
01:55:52,770 --> 01:55:55,006
shielded, how does the
entity expect to get in?

1252
01:55:55,046 --> 01:55:57,166
It expects us to let it in.

1253
01:55:57,826 --> 01:56:00,766
Just like Gabriel expects me to hand off
the bar of power.

1254
01:56:01,106 --> 01:56:02,626
Neither would you ever do, obviously.

1255
01:56:04,486 --> 01:56:05,486
Right?

1256
01:56:05,926 --> 01:56:06,686
Think about it.

1257
01:56:06,826 --> 01:56:08,446
The vault is electronically shielded.

1258
01:56:08,447 --> 01:56:11,046
No signals get in or not.

1259
01:56:11,386 --> 01:56:14,705
Someone has to go
outside the vault in order

1260
01:56:14,706 --> 01:56:17,706
to upload Luther's
poison pill to the entity.

1261
01:56:17,786 --> 01:56:24,987
And if Gabriel wants to control the entity,
he has to upload Luther's poison pill.

1262
01:56:26,426 --> 01:56:29,065
You're not seriously
going to give him the

1263
01:56:29,066 --> 01:56:31,546
park over and let him
get away with the pill.

1264
01:56:31,926 --> 01:56:34,286
That's exactly what I'm going to do.

1265
01:56:34,986 --> 01:56:37,806
Gabriel will be part of the team and never
know what to do.

1266
01:56:37,807 --> 01:56:38,846
That's insane.

1267
01:56:39,426 --> 01:56:41,106
You're letting the entity into the vault.

1268
01:56:41,326 --> 01:56:43,366
That's precisely what it wants you to do.

1269
01:56:43,466 --> 01:56:46,006
It is right here.

1270
01:56:46,166 --> 01:56:47,166
Yes.

1271
01:56:47,386 --> 01:56:49,566
As you only chose, we have a beating
Gabriel.

1272
01:56:49,886 --> 01:56:50,466
Have the entity.

1273
01:56:50,666 --> 01:56:51,706
When John's in a trillion.

1274
01:56:51,866 --> 01:56:53,486
Ethan, think about what you're doing.

1275
01:56:53,926 --> 01:56:55,586
Think about how you got here.

1276
01:56:55,746 --> 01:56:57,546
Think about how the world got here.

1277
01:56:57,626 --> 01:57:00,826
How do you know that the entity didn't
want you to recover the pot over?

1278
01:57:01,246 --> 01:57:02,786
Maybe it told you it was
impossible because it

1279
01:57:02,787 --> 01:57:04,887
knew that was the thing
that you needed to hear.

1280
01:57:06,566 --> 01:57:08,026
How would you think of it?

1281
01:57:08,846 --> 01:57:13,846
I think you're risking the fate of the
world and billions of lives.

1282
01:57:14,366 --> 01:57:15,466
I'm a bit of a liar.

1283
01:57:16,066 --> 01:57:17,066
Yes, right.

1284
01:57:17,806 --> 01:57:18,806
I am.

1285
01:57:20,526 --> 01:57:23,206
If there was another choice, I'd dare you.

1286
01:57:24,126 --> 01:57:29,246
I know you all have your doubts and I don't
blame you, but we have to stick together.

1287
01:57:29,247 --> 01:57:35,006
And we have to make sure that grace is the
one to disconnect that drive.

1288
01:57:36,186 --> 01:57:37,186
Me?

1289
01:57:37,966 --> 01:57:42,526
What separates could pay pocket from a
great one?

1290
01:57:46,416 --> 01:57:47,416
Timing.

1291
01:57:48,156 --> 01:57:49,256
Thank you for that.

1292
01:59:38,896 --> 01:59:40,796
The entity is moving now.

1293
01:59:40,976 --> 01:59:43,296
Matter of President, Hunt is gone.

1294
01:59:43,536 --> 01:59:45,616
If he isn't dead, the Russians have him.

1295
01:59:45,776 --> 01:59:48,265
If we lose control of
our arsenal, we lose any

1296
01:59:48,266 --> 01:59:50,276
hope of preventing the
entity from launching.

1297
01:59:50,736 --> 01:59:52,916
We are out of time.

1298
01:59:57,086 --> 01:59:58,086
General Sydney.

1299
01:59:59,306 --> 02:00:01,586
What is our most limited attack option?

1300
02:00:01,587 --> 02:00:05,066
Surgical nuclear strikes can
find strictly to the command

1301
02:00:05,067 --> 02:00:08,706
centers of the eight nations
under the entity's control.

1302
02:00:08,707 --> 02:00:11,846
Beijing is now about London.

1303
02:00:12,826 --> 02:00:18,146
Moscow, New Delhi, Paris, Pyongyang and
Tel Aviv.

1304
02:00:19,266 --> 02:00:20,266
Casualties.

1305
02:00:20,866 --> 02:00:23,806
Estimated death tolls from initial
strikes.

1306
02:00:25,486 --> 02:00:29,866
And more later, of course, from resulting
nuclear fallout.

1307
02:00:29,867 --> 02:00:33,786
Estimates vary.

1308
02:00:34,466 --> 02:00:37,682
Obviously, the bombing of
major cities in eight different

1309
02:00:37,683 --> 02:00:41,086
countries would create an
unprecedented political crisis.

1310
02:00:41,486 --> 02:00:45,606
One would likely lead to a protracted
global more.

1311
02:00:45,806 --> 02:00:52,346
It may be diplomatically prudent to make a
gesture.

1312
02:00:54,846 --> 02:00:55,646
A gesture.

1313
02:00:55,647 --> 02:00:59,926
Sacrifice one of our cities here at home.

1314
02:01:00,946 --> 02:01:03,886
We've prepared a list.

1315
02:01:05,406 --> 02:01:12,526
Cities have been raised by strategic and
economic importance and population,

1316
02:01:12,966 --> 02:01:13,966
of course.

1317
02:01:14,386 --> 02:01:17,066
You'd be sacrificing a hundred million
lives.

1318
02:01:18,266 --> 02:01:20,086
To save seven billion.

1319
02:01:22,046 --> 02:01:23,506
This can't be happening.

1320
02:01:23,507 --> 02:01:27,606
But in person, we are in the entities
reality now.

1321
02:01:28,846 --> 02:01:31,946
And this is jigmy.

1322
02:01:48,086 --> 02:01:51,786
The military soldiers, and their side on.

1323
02:01:52,766 --> 02:01:56,906
So, you heard me say, hand it over.

1324
02:02:11,686 --> 02:02:12,866
The military is over.

1325
02:02:14,646 --> 02:02:15,946
The military is over.

1326
02:02:15,947 --> 02:02:16,947
The military is over.

1327
02:02:17,806 --> 02:02:19,786
The rest of you, you just wait here.

1328
02:02:20,806 --> 02:02:21,926
Don't hand it over.

1329
02:02:22,826 --> 02:02:23,826
If you like to.

1330
02:02:25,246 --> 02:02:27,346
Someone wants to get lost.

1331
02:02:51,096 --> 02:02:52,436
It's too early to survive.

1332
02:02:53,776 --> 02:02:54,776
It's too exposed.

1333
02:02:56,096 --> 02:02:57,256
It's too close to the others.

1334
02:02:58,616 --> 02:03:00,736
The gate brings the night you kill you.

1335
02:03:00,896 --> 02:03:03,776
It has to leave you with the bill and the
vodka.

1336
02:03:04,716 --> 02:03:05,756
I'm respectable.

1337
02:03:06,496 --> 02:03:07,996
Either of you are.

1338
02:03:09,016 --> 02:03:10,016
That's right.

1339
02:03:20,526 --> 02:03:21,786
Take care of you, Tim.

1340
02:04:34,966 --> 02:04:39,146
I'm now let's go of that button and the
entity has no place to heart.

1341
02:04:39,486 --> 02:04:40,706
But what happens to you?

1342
02:04:41,206 --> 02:04:44,926
I have a plan that'll take me to minimum
safety systems.

1343
02:04:45,626 --> 02:04:47,306
Reliable, animal law.

1344
02:04:47,466 --> 02:04:48,906
I'm not afraid of it.

1345
02:04:49,206 --> 02:04:50,626
I've been by this man.

1346
02:04:51,226 --> 02:04:52,226
Just in case.

1347
02:04:52,506 --> 02:04:56,606
And you honestly believe destroying this
place will stop the entity from much.

1348
02:04:56,786 --> 02:04:58,286
I think it's bluffing.

1349
02:04:58,586 --> 02:05:00,280
Alone in the world if
you can't survive, and

1350
02:05:00,281 --> 02:05:02,446
you can't survive
if you don't let it in.

1351
02:05:02,906 --> 02:05:05,906
I hand over the vodka and I let you walk
away.

1352
02:05:06,346 --> 02:05:07,646
Why would I believe that?

1353
02:05:07,826 --> 02:05:09,026
Because I want you.

1354
02:05:09,826 --> 02:05:11,306
And everyone you care about.

1355
02:05:12,366 --> 02:05:14,566
To live long lives in the world I create.

1356
02:05:14,567 --> 02:05:17,686
And the entity answers to me.

1357
02:05:18,466 --> 02:05:24,006
You'll be using it not today, some other
place, some other time.

1358
02:05:24,766 --> 02:05:29,386
As long as I have this, wherever I go,
you will follow.

1359
02:05:30,286 --> 02:05:32,786
And the vodka will come to me.

1360
02:05:33,046 --> 02:05:34,926
That is written.

1361
02:05:35,546 --> 02:05:36,746
Nothing is written.

1362
02:05:37,866 --> 02:05:39,206
I'm not sure it is written.

1363
02:05:40,726 --> 02:05:41,806
I'm not sure it is written.

1364
02:05:42,286 --> 02:05:46,546
Now, tell me I win.

1365
02:05:56,886 --> 02:05:57,886
You win.

1366
02:05:58,206 --> 02:05:59,866
I like the sound of it.

1367
02:06:00,546 --> 02:06:01,546
Say it again.

1368
02:06:02,406 --> 02:06:03,406
Uh-huh.

1369
02:06:04,806 --> 02:06:06,166
And why don't you dig it?

1370
02:06:39,256 --> 02:06:40,256
10.

1371
02:06:41,056 --> 02:06:42,056
10.

1372
02:06:42,096 --> 02:06:42,196
10?

1373
02:06:42,197 --> 02:06:43,197
18 minutes.

1374
02:06:48,466 --> 02:06:49,526
I don't know you.

1375
02:06:49,906 --> 02:06:50,906
Don't love.

1376
02:06:51,006 --> 02:06:52,126
William, don't love.

1377
02:06:52,306 --> 02:06:52,946
My wife.

1378
02:06:53,246 --> 02:06:54,426
It's a piece of it.

1379
02:06:54,486 --> 02:06:55,766
I really hand it to you, huh?

1380
02:06:55,806 --> 02:06:57,286
This is one of Crocker, Jackie.

1381
02:06:57,406 --> 02:06:58,286
You let you put together.

1382
02:06:58,287 --> 02:07:02,666
I'm imagining the entity is shaking at its
virtual shorts right up now.

1383
02:07:02,846 --> 02:07:04,206
What do I need to know about this?

1384
02:07:04,326 --> 02:07:06,866
And what exactly was the play?

1385
02:07:06,867 --> 02:07:09,946
I think players give that to him and let
him go right now.

1386
02:07:10,026 --> 02:07:14,106
You want me to give this to him and let
him go right now.

1387
02:07:14,346 --> 02:07:14,586
Right now.

1388
02:07:14,587 --> 02:07:15,046
Right now.

1389
02:07:15,047 --> 02:07:16,047
Right now.

1390
02:07:16,726 --> 02:07:20,126
The president of the United States is
preparing to vaporize millions upon

1391
02:07:20,127 --> 02:07:22,599
millions of souls, only
because even here doesn't

1392
02:07:22,600 --> 02:07:26,406
believe that anyone can
safely control the entity.

1393
02:07:26,407 --> 02:07:29,346
Does that sound the same to anyone?

1394
02:07:29,886 --> 02:07:33,206
Maybe you should ask the crew for the
semester bomb.

1395
02:07:35,046 --> 02:07:35,466
10?

1396
02:07:36,026 --> 02:07:36,546
17 minutes.

1397
02:07:37,006 --> 02:07:39,886
You wouldn't be here if he didn't have a
plan.

1398
02:07:40,386 --> 02:07:44,069
Whoever tells me what that
plan is when we spend millions

1399
02:07:44,070 --> 02:07:46,587
of lives, and you'll be
spared the fate of the others.

1400
02:07:46,766 --> 02:07:47,486
So we're running out of time.

1401
02:07:47,606 --> 02:07:49,986
We need to get to a minimum safe business
while we're still standing here.

1402
02:07:49,987 --> 02:07:53,086
Because he's here, and he's here.

1403
02:07:53,087 --> 02:07:55,446
And this means something.

1404
02:07:55,447 --> 02:08:00,166
Any second now, Ethan's going to tell me
what it is.

1405
02:08:00,846 --> 02:08:02,866
I've known this man for a long time.

1406
02:08:03,246 --> 02:08:08,726
And he won't want anything to happen to
his precious team.

1407
02:08:13,056 --> 02:08:15,256
That's the pattern, isn't it?

1408
02:08:15,776 --> 02:08:20,976
He refused to sacrifice the ones who hold
close.

1409
02:08:23,436 --> 02:08:25,976
That is why we're still here.

1410
02:08:27,096 --> 02:08:28,096
It's over.

1411
02:08:28,816 --> 02:08:29,816
There's no shame.

1412
02:08:31,596 --> 02:08:33,717
I'm just... Tell me
what I'm missing.

1413
02:08:51,486 --> 02:08:52,486
Damn.

1414
02:09:08,406 --> 02:09:09,406
Get him!

1415
02:09:12,866 --> 02:09:13,246
Get him!

1416
02:09:13,346 --> 02:09:14,346
Get him!

1417
02:09:14,606 --> 02:09:14,826
Get him!

1418
02:09:14,827 --> 02:09:15,026
Get him!

1419
02:09:15,027 --> 02:09:16,027
Get him!

1420
02:09:27,406 --> 02:09:28,106
Get him!

1421
02:09:28,107 --> 02:09:28,886
Get the pills!

1422
02:09:29,066 --> 02:09:31,146
Look at the silver and the next here!

1423
02:09:35,786 --> 02:09:37,206
What's bigger than that?

1424
02:09:37,586 --> 02:09:38,746
You want to get in the bones?

1425
02:09:38,866 --> 02:09:39,866
The new keel bones.

1426
02:09:40,146 --> 02:09:41,486
What bigger than that?

1427
02:09:41,786 --> 02:09:42,786
Ethan!

1428
02:09:42,866 --> 02:09:43,066
Come!

1429
02:09:43,406 --> 02:09:44,426
I got this!

1430
02:10:06,576 --> 02:10:08,676
That's what he's got in there.

1431
02:10:16,286 --> 02:10:22,106
There you go, bricks.

1432
02:10:22,786 --> 02:10:23,786
It's your turn.

1433
02:11:16,986 --> 02:11:19,846
It's your turn.

1434
02:12:14,146 --> 02:12:15,146
It'll

1435
02:12:45,146 --> 02:12:46,046
be a way to disarm it.

1436
02:12:46,106 --> 02:12:48,130
Even if you can prevent it
from going nuclear, there's

1437
02:12:48,131 --> 02:12:50,387
still no way you can stop
those detonators from exploding.

1438
02:12:50,606 --> 02:12:52,322
Can we survive the blast from the server,
though?

1439
02:12:52,346 --> 02:12:55,226
I'll use someone who stays behind and
stops the bomb from going critical.

1440
02:12:55,806 --> 02:12:58,246
But whoever that is, they're not going to
make it.

1441
02:13:00,126 --> 02:13:01,246
Keep heavy, huh?

1442
02:13:01,566 --> 02:13:02,566
A killer boy.

1443
02:13:05,876 --> 02:13:06,876
We'll handle the bomb.

1444
02:13:07,076 --> 02:13:08,956
The rest of you can bend you to the server
room.

1445
02:13:10,136 --> 02:13:12,016
There's no time to discuss it.

1446
02:13:12,056 --> 02:13:13,056
Go!

1447
02:13:22,096 --> 02:13:24,676
I'll stay with them.

1448
02:13:25,036 --> 02:13:27,096
There's another community doing the server
room.

1449
02:13:28,196 --> 02:13:29,196
Good luck.

1450
02:15:01,066 --> 02:15:02,506
How did you learn to do this?

1451
02:15:02,806 --> 02:15:04,186
I never said I did.

1452
02:15:21,886 --> 02:15:22,886
Good luck.

1453
02:15:23,466 --> 02:15:24,486
Oh, no, this is not good.

1454
02:15:24,746 --> 02:15:24,966
Why is that?

1455
02:15:25,706 --> 02:15:28,426
If I had to guess it's a potential name of
Thorax.

1456
02:15:28,646 --> 02:15:29,006
What does that mean?

1457
02:15:29,246 --> 02:15:30,806
Where's your building in the pearl cup?

1458
02:15:31,946 --> 02:15:32,986
My lung is glass.

1459
02:15:33,566 --> 02:15:35,206
If we don't act fast, it means saucation.

1460
02:15:35,986 --> 02:15:36,986
Oh, God, I had grass.

1461
02:15:38,126 --> 02:15:39,886
Do either of you have any medical
experience.

1462
02:15:40,926 --> 02:15:43,186
Have you seen a tree?

1463
02:15:44,006 --> 02:15:45,646
You got to work with him.

1464
02:15:45,726 --> 02:15:48,686
Christ, I need you to hack the server so
we can let the head steer.

1465
02:15:48,986 --> 02:15:50,346
Grab the tools, head to the power.

1466
02:15:50,926 --> 02:15:52,126
Here's two other ones.

1467
02:15:53,586 --> 02:15:54,586
A good one.

1468
02:15:55,126 --> 02:15:56,666
First, I need you to plug the blow.

1469
02:15:56,886 --> 02:15:58,266
We can anti-peel them.

1470
02:15:59,006 --> 02:16:00,006
Bondage.

1471
02:16:00,166 --> 02:16:01,166
Bondage, save a blade.

1472
02:16:15,986 --> 02:16:16,986
I

1473
02:17:00,616 --> 02:17:02,576
need you to divide the power switch now.

1474
02:17:02,776 --> 02:17:04,217
To the servers in jukeling that one.

1475
02:17:04,376 --> 02:17:04,696
Got it.

1476
02:17:05,076 --> 02:17:06,216
Christ, I'm gonna cover you.

1477
02:17:06,656 --> 02:17:07,456
Go, go, go.

1478
02:17:07,457 --> 02:17:08,457
The other block.

1479
02:17:10,276 --> 02:17:11,276
That's it.

1480
02:17:12,396 --> 02:17:13,676
That's it.

1481
02:17:13,677 --> 02:17:16,276
That's it.

1482
02:17:20,056 --> 02:17:20,696
That's it.

1483
02:17:21,016 --> 02:17:22,016
That's it.

1484
02:17:22,556 --> 02:17:23,556
What's up?

1485
02:17:24,196 --> 02:17:26,196
If the person survived.

1486
02:17:27,536 --> 02:17:29,296
Oh, Christ.

1487
02:17:32,996 --> 02:17:33,636
Oh, Christ.

1488
02:17:33,637 --> 02:17:38,316
Oh, my God.

1489
02:17:38,576 --> 02:17:39,576
Spirit, don't say.

1490
02:17:41,176 --> 02:17:42,176
This is up a lot.

1491
02:17:42,656 --> 02:17:44,256
Christ, it's okay.

1492
02:17:44,716 --> 02:17:46,316
Yeah, but you shut it off.

1493
02:17:47,096 --> 02:17:48,816
Well, that's something better.

1494
02:17:50,236 --> 02:17:51,416
What's that, it's the answer.

1495
02:17:51,417 --> 02:17:53,416
All right.

1496
02:18:03,746 --> 02:18:05,426
You see?

1497
02:18:09,966 --> 02:18:14,726
Oh, everything's under control here.

1498
02:18:15,526 --> 02:18:15,586
Okay.

1499
02:18:15,726 --> 02:18:17,246
Hope is very steady.

1500
02:18:18,246 --> 02:18:20,226
But don't pull it out.

1501
02:18:42,646 --> 02:18:45,126
It's like I said, he threw.

1502
02:18:47,546 --> 02:18:53,986
As long as I have to kill the park over
will come to me.

1503
02:19:48,366 --> 02:19:50,466
These ground wires are triple redundant.

1504
02:19:51,226 --> 02:19:53,384
If we cut any three of
them simultaneously,

1505
02:19:53,385 --> 02:19:55,786
we get to lay these
detonators from exploding.

1506
02:19:56,246 --> 02:19:59,346
Maybe long enough for someone to make it
to the server run.

1507
02:19:59,546 --> 02:20:01,886
Oh, 10 seconds.

1508
02:20:02,666 --> 02:20:03,666
Maybe.

1509
02:20:04,146 --> 02:20:06,186
You think you can make with that door in
10 seconds.

1510
02:20:09,646 --> 02:20:10,966
I'm only to find out.

1511
02:20:11,266 --> 02:20:12,266
I'm in the restroom.

1512
02:20:12,726 --> 02:20:13,726
Okay.

1513
02:20:13,926 --> 02:20:15,566
We're not out of the woods yet.

1514
02:20:15,766 --> 02:20:18,962
Any minute now my blood pressure is gonna
drop drastically and I'm gonna go fake.

1515
02:20:18,986 --> 02:20:20,346
So we need to work fast.

1516
02:20:20,826 --> 02:20:22,146
Let's receive her in the tool bag.

1517
02:20:22,147 --> 02:20:25,246
The server blocks two lights on it.

1518
02:20:25,346 --> 02:20:25,586
Got it.

1519
02:20:25,686 --> 02:20:27,806
We need to splice that into the server's
solar panels.

1520
02:20:27,866 --> 02:20:28,866
It can untamble.

1521
02:20:29,126 --> 02:20:31,462
That way we'll know where anything's
uploaded in the poison tower.

1522
02:20:31,486 --> 02:20:31,886
Yeah.

1523
02:20:32,026 --> 02:20:32,406
Got it.

1524
02:20:32,446 --> 02:20:32,666
Okay.

1525
02:20:32,686 --> 02:20:34,086
Now this is the really tricky part.

1526
02:20:34,346 --> 02:20:37,846
There is a bundle of blue, black,
and red cables in the lower right corner.

1527
02:20:38,686 --> 02:20:39,966
Oh, I want to be there.

1528
02:20:40,246 --> 02:20:42,086
I'm gonna need you to cut through the
wires.

1529
02:20:42,326 --> 02:20:43,846
I'm gonna specifically go in the back.

1530
02:20:44,006 --> 02:20:45,006
Whatever you do.

1531
02:20:45,366 --> 02:20:46,366
Do not.

1532
02:20:46,566 --> 02:20:47,566
Color.

1533
02:20:49,886 --> 02:20:50,446
Fangit!

1534
02:20:50,786 --> 02:20:52,626
It's a regular set.

1535
02:20:53,866 --> 02:20:58,246
Madam President, as you secretary of
defense, I direct your attention

1536
02:20:58,247 --> 02:21:03,546
toConplant 8044, selected to tack option
9.1.

1537
02:21:03,926 --> 02:21:06,711
A targeted nuclear strike
on the command centers

1538
02:21:06,712 --> 02:21:09,586
of all eight nations now
controlled by the entity.

1539
02:21:10,106 --> 02:21:14,026
A mandate to include the American City of
chosen to sacrifice.

1540
02:21:15,646 --> 02:21:16,766
The disco.

1541
02:21:30,306 --> 02:21:30,866
The disco.

1542
02:21:30,867 --> 02:21:32,246
And he's pulling your son.

1543
02:21:34,366 --> 02:21:35,606
What, what I tell you?

1544
02:21:36,446 --> 02:21:36,606
What?

1545
02:21:36,846 --> 02:21:38,546
Authentication could've been for me.

1546
02:21:55,906 --> 02:21:57,006
Come on, Ethan.

1547
02:21:57,846 --> 02:21:58,846
No way you've been.

1548
02:21:59,706 --> 02:22:01,746
Any minute now your two will be dead.

1549
02:22:02,426 --> 02:22:04,726
And the entity will have no place to hide.

1550
02:22:22,806 --> 02:22:25,826
I am the entity who lies here to me.

1551
02:22:26,086 --> 02:22:27,406
It's only a matter of time.

1552
02:22:30,926 --> 02:22:32,443
Grace, we think we can
perfect this bond for one

1553
02:22:32,444 --> 02:22:34,527
nuclear, but all of these
dead natives are with his flow.

1554
02:22:34,586 --> 02:22:35,586
Have a good blast.

1555
02:22:36,106 --> 02:22:37,266
It's been a pleasure talking.

1556
02:22:39,726 --> 02:22:40,726
Big.

1557
02:22:41,346 --> 02:22:42,802
Ethan, he's all the time we can give him.

1558
02:22:42,826 --> 02:22:45,286
Do not make the last cut until we
absolutely have to.

1559
02:22:51,356 --> 02:22:52,356
Madam President.

1560
02:22:52,816 --> 02:22:55,116
Launch is now enabled.

1561
02:23:23,336 --> 02:23:24,336
What are you doing?

1562
02:23:24,656 --> 02:23:27,436
What we should have done in the very
space.

1563
02:23:27,976 --> 02:23:28,596
What a U.S.

1564
02:23:28,696 --> 02:23:29,916
treaty to command center.

1565
02:23:30,776 --> 02:23:32,336
To cut their power.

1566
02:23:32,796 --> 02:23:34,596
To come, Mrs. offline entirely.

1567
02:23:35,836 --> 02:23:36,956
Sure, there's anything down.

1568
02:23:37,116 --> 02:23:40,556
Madam President, that would give the
country a completely defenseless.

1569
02:23:41,276 --> 02:23:45,476
But deny the entity access to the largest
entity in our smaller world.

1570
02:23:45,876 --> 02:23:47,136
Now, make the call.

1571
02:23:47,876 --> 02:23:51,856
Now, we are the only nation on earth with
the power to attack the entity.

1572
02:23:52,156 --> 02:23:54,916
Now, we're the only nation in the world
with the power of choice.

1573
02:23:55,356 --> 02:23:56,956
Today, I choose not to attack.

1574
02:23:57,016 --> 02:23:57,656
Not a President.

1575
02:23:57,816 --> 02:23:58,816
Think this through.

1576
02:23:58,936 --> 02:24:00,756
You are making a terrible mistake.

1577
02:24:01,136 --> 02:24:02,416
The sake of the country, please.

1578
02:24:02,836 --> 02:24:03,396
Listen to Reese.

1579
02:24:03,676 --> 02:24:04,952
I was asking him what I'm doing.

1580
02:24:04,976 --> 02:24:06,576
Connecting with strategic command agent.

1581
02:24:06,756 --> 02:24:08,256
No, it's the people who die, man.

1582
02:24:08,276 --> 02:24:09,216
If you don't push that button.

1583
02:24:09,296 --> 02:24:10,616
Millions of other people who die.

1584
02:24:10,676 --> 02:24:12,292
If she does, what gives us the right to
decide?

1585
02:24:12,316 --> 02:24:13,476
Who lives in U.S.?

1586
02:24:13,477 --> 02:24:14,477
We took an oath.

1587
02:24:14,556 --> 02:24:17,396
As President of the United States
launched, none of that won't matter.

1588
02:24:17,916 --> 02:24:18,376
Nothing won't matter.

1589
02:24:18,616 --> 02:24:19,436
I'm inclined to agree.

1590
02:24:19,437 --> 02:24:21,176
I'm afraid that I'll deal with his
entities.

1591
02:24:21,396 --> 02:24:22,676
Prepare to attack, man.

1592
02:24:22,696 --> 02:24:25,176
You may choose to live in the entities
where we have a teacher.

1593
02:24:25,896 --> 02:24:26,896
I don't.

1594
02:24:26,936 --> 02:24:27,936
Vote for the President.

1595
02:24:28,576 --> 02:24:30,232
General Oakton's office strategic command.

1596
02:24:30,256 --> 02:24:31,816
General Oakton, this is the President.

1597
02:24:31,936 --> 02:24:34,296
Call you from up with the authority that
has command.

1598
02:24:34,756 --> 02:24:37,576
I need you to listen to my instructors who
are usually funded.

1599
02:24:47,176 --> 02:24:48,176
I'm sorry.

1600
02:25:03,446 --> 02:25:08,456
Do you know who he is?

1601
02:25:54,436 --> 02:25:56,196
It's still me feeling it's myself,
man.

1602
02:25:56,456 --> 02:25:58,736
But it still needs to play style before it
launches.

1603
02:25:59,376 --> 02:25:59,796
It's hard to regret.

1604
02:25:59,797 --> 02:26:00,636
I've got it.

1605
02:26:00,776 --> 02:26:01,216
It's done.

1606
02:26:01,496 --> 02:26:02,496
We'll see this connected.

1607
02:26:02,536 --> 02:26:02,896
Okay.

1608
02:26:03,336 --> 02:26:03,756
Here we go.

1609
02:26:03,796 --> 02:26:05,916
We're going to switch the power back off.

1610
02:26:08,416 --> 02:26:09,536
We'll see if it's activated.

1611
02:26:09,776 --> 02:26:10,476
Red light is on.

1612
02:26:10,676 --> 02:26:11,056
Take off.

1613
02:26:11,256 --> 02:26:11,596
How are we doing?

1614
02:26:11,736 --> 02:26:11,996
Great.

1615
02:26:12,116 --> 02:26:13,576
We're starting to let's get here.

1616
02:26:13,696 --> 02:26:14,712
We're ready to get the fuses.

1617
02:26:14,736 --> 02:26:15,776
Four minutes on the clock.

1618
02:26:16,276 --> 02:26:16,636
Understood.

1619
02:26:16,856 --> 02:26:17,396
Four minutes.

1620
02:26:17,756 --> 02:26:18,756
Let's start the drive.

1621
02:26:20,296 --> 02:26:20,456
Ready.

1622
02:26:20,856 --> 02:26:22,936
Now you're going to watch the lights on
the receiver.

1623
02:26:23,576 --> 02:26:26,796
When the red lights was... Ah!

1624
02:26:27,396 --> 02:26:28,396
Wait, what's that?

1625
02:26:28,476 --> 02:26:29,716
When the red light was green?

1626
02:26:29,717 --> 02:26:32,616
Your noise is connected to the felt of a
pokoma.

1627
02:26:33,596 --> 02:26:36,112
And the answer to your spoon, thanks to
resources, all throughout.

1628
02:26:36,136 --> 02:26:36,956
Okay, then what?

1629
02:26:37,116 --> 02:26:37,496
Then?

1630
02:26:37,816 --> 02:26:40,956
You're going to cut that red wire and let
the answer in.

1631
02:26:42,116 --> 02:26:44,016
What we need now is to fill it together.

1632
02:26:45,956 --> 02:26:46,956
Let's take a look.

1633
02:26:46,957 --> 02:26:47,957
Let's take a look.

1634
02:32:05,996 --> 02:32:07,476
We're almost out of time.

1635
02:32:07,756 --> 02:32:12,696
At 10 seconds, I'm going to come backwards
from three, two, one, cut.

1636
02:32:13,076 --> 02:32:14,516
And we were like hell for that door.

1637
02:32:15,036 --> 02:32:15,376
Remember?

1638
02:32:15,816 --> 02:32:17,216
And then drive next time.

1639
02:32:17,536 --> 02:32:18,736
You know the answer is inside.

1640
02:32:19,796 --> 02:32:20,896
You have 100 milliseconds.

1641
02:35:26,746 --> 02:35:29,686
This is where I said it.

1642
02:35:39,366 --> 02:35:41,846
He did it.

1643
02:35:44,366 --> 02:35:45,906
That was sort of a badge.

1644
02:35:46,226 --> 02:35:47,226
That was short.

1645
02:36:40,536 --> 02:36:45,376
You can see this life is not some quirk of
fate.

1646
02:36:46,956 --> 02:36:48,076
This is what you're calling.

1647
02:36:49,116 --> 02:36:50,156
You're destiny.

1648
02:36:51,976 --> 02:36:55,816
You're destiny that touches every living
thing.

1649
02:36:57,936 --> 02:37:01,856
Like you're not your masters of our fate.

1650
02:37:03,416 --> 02:37:05,496
Nothing... It's raining.

1651
02:37:08,886 --> 02:37:10,146
And our cause.

1652
02:37:11,506 --> 02:37:17,306
However, rages, chaos and vampires,
to the impact of

1653
02:37:21,456 --> 02:37:29,196
our inner hope for a better future,
comes from willing that future and to be a

1654
02:37:29,197 --> 02:37:33,616
future reflecting the measure of good
within ourselves.

1655
02:37:35,436 --> 02:37:37,896
And all that is good inside us.

1656
02:37:37,897 --> 02:37:40,376
This measure worth good.

1657
02:37:41,516 --> 02:37:42,516
We do fathers.

1658
02:37:46,686 --> 02:37:51,286
We all share the same fate, the same
future.

1659
02:37:54,766 --> 02:37:57,846
There's some of our infinite choices.

1660
02:37:59,986 --> 02:38:05,186
Once as future is built on kindness,
trust, and we to understand.

1661
02:38:09,226 --> 02:38:12,546
To do something.

1662
02:38:16,596 --> 02:38:19,276
Driving without question.

1663
02:38:20,436 --> 02:38:23,036
Towards the light we cannot see.

1664
02:38:26,436 --> 02:38:29,156
Not just for those we are all close.

1665
02:38:34,036 --> 02:38:36,756
But for those we'll never meet.

1666
02:38:40,516 --> 02:38:44,376
I hope you know how always love you
brother.

1667
02:38:45,936 --> 02:38:47,936
And I will see you again.

1668
02:38:49,336 --> 02:38:51,316
I hope it's not too soon.

1669
02:38:57,616 --> 02:39:00,436
The world still needs you.

1670
02:39:03,886 --> 02:39:04,886
But we do.

1671
02:39:07,876 --> 02:39:10,076
We live and die.

1672
02:39:13,366 --> 02:39:18,506
This message will self-destruct in five
seconds.

1673
02:39:20,466 --> 02:39:21,666
Good luck, Ethan.
