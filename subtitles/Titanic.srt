13 metres. You should see it.

(Sonar pings)

4
00:02:06,154 --> 00:02:09,271
Okay.
Take her up and over the bow rail.

5
00:02:09,354 --> 00:02:14,223
<i>Okay, Mir 2, we're going over the bow.</i>
<i>Stay with us.</i>

(Mechanical whirring)

8
00:02:45,954 --> 00:02:48,070
Okay, quiet. We're rolling.

9
00:02:48,154 --> 00:02:51,829
Seeing her coming out
of the darkness like a ghost ship...

10
00:02:51,914 --> 00:02:53,632
..still gets me every time.

11
00:02:53,714 --> 00:02:58,310
To see the sad ruin
of the great ship sitting here...

12
00:02:58,394 --> 00:03:03,832
..where she landed at 2:30
in the morning of April 15, 1912,...

13
00:03:03,874 --> 00:03:05,990
..after her long fall...

14
00:03:06,994 --> 00:03:08,985
..from the world above.

15
00:03:09,714 --> 00:03:11,750
You are so full of shit, boss!

16
00:03:13,154 --> 00:03:15,065
(Mechanical whirring)

17
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:17,145
(Sonar pinging)

18
00:03:39,794 --> 00:03:43,707
Dive six - here we are again
on the deck of Titanic.

19
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:49,670
2 1/2 miles down, 3,821 meters.

20
00:03:49,754 --> 00:03:53,030
The pressure outside
is 3 1/2 tons per square inch.

21
00:03:53,114 --> 00:03:55,423
These windows are nine inches thick.

22
00:03:55,514 --> 00:03:59,348
If they go,
it's sayonara in two microseconds.

23
00:03:59,434 --> 00:04:02,028
All right. Enough of that bullshit.

24
00:04:15,194 --> 00:04:18,425
Put her down on the roof
of the officers' quarters.

25
00:04:18,594 --> 00:04:19,709
Sure.

26
00:04:19,794 --> 00:04:21,432
<i>Okay, Mir 2.</i>

27
00:04:21,514 --> 00:04:25,348
<i>We've landed on the grand staircase.</i>
<i>You guys set to launch?</i>

28
00:04:25,434 --> 00:04:27,994
Yeah. Launching Dunkin now.
Go, Charlie.

29
00:04:35,514 --> 00:04:37,823
- Tether out.
- Tether out.

30
00:04:37,914 --> 00:04:41,907
Okay, Brock,
we're dropping down along the hull.

31
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:47,550
Roger that. Okay, drop down and go
into the first-class gangway door.

32
00:04:47,634 --> 00:04:51,593
I want you guys working the "D" deck,
reception and the dining saloon.

33
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:53,505
Copy that.

34
00:04:59,474 --> 00:05:01,112
- Tether out.
- Tether out.

35
00:05:01,194 --> 00:05:03,230
- Now left.
- I'm coming left.

36
00:05:10,354 --> 00:05:12,868
Brock: <i>Snoop Dog is on the move.</i>

37
00:05:12,954 --> 00:05:15,343
<i>We're headed down the stairwell.</i>

38
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,304
Okay, Lewis. Drop down to "B" deck.

39
00:05:19,394 --> 00:05:20,622
Okay. "A" deck.

40
00:05:20,714 --> 00:05:22,705
Lewis: Give me some rope, Captain.

41
00:05:22,794 --> 00:05:23,783
"B" deck. Get in there.

42
00:06:00,474 --> 00:06:02,704
Brock: Watch the doorframe.

43
00:06:02,794 --> 00:06:04,512
I see it. I got it.

44
00:06:04,594 --> 00:06:06,027

We're good... Just chill, boss.

00:06:25,394 --> 00:06:27,225
Brock: Make your turn.

49
00:06:27,314 --> 00:06:30,306

- Make your turn.

50
00:06:30,394 --> 00:06:32,703
Brock, we're at the piano.
You copy?

51
00:06:32,794 --> 00:06:34,785
Brock: <i>Okay, copy that.</i>

52
00:06:41,674 --> 00:06:44,108
Brock: Right there, that's it!

53
00:06:44,194 --> 00:06:47,266
- That's the bedroom door!
- I see it... I see it.

54
00:06:55,754 --> 00:06:56,948
We're in!

55

We're in, baby, we're there!

56

Brock: That's Hockley's bed.

57
00:07:02,194 --> 00:07:04,754
That's where the son of a bitch slept.

58
00:07:09,874 --> 00:07:12,593
Lewis: Somebody left the water running.

59
00:07:12,674 --> 00:07:15,234
Hold it. Go back to the right.

60
00:07:21,114 --> 00:07:23,753
That wardrobe door... Get closer.

61
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:27,144
- You smelling something, boss?
- I wanna see what's under it.

62
00:07:27,234 --> 00:07:28,667
Gimme my hands, man.

63
00:07:28,754 --> 00:07:30,153
(Mechanical whirring)

64
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:35,426
All right...!

65
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:40,509
- Take it easy. It might come apart.
- Okay.

66
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:41,822
Go! Go, go, go!

67
00:07:41,914 --> 00:07:43,870
Flip it over, flip it over. Go.

Keep going. Go, go, go.

69
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:47,823
Okay. Drop it.

70
00:07:56,354 --> 00:07:59,710
Oh, baby, baby...
Are you seeing this, boss?

71
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,705
It's payday, boys.

Ka-ching!

74
00:08:21,274 --> 00:08:22,912
We did it, Bobby!

75
00:08:22,994 --> 00:08:25,952

Who's the best, baby?

Say it, say it.

00:08:29,394 --> 00:08:31,271
You are, Lewis.

80
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:35,470
- Bobby, my cigar.
- Right here.

(Cheering)

82
00:08:42,714 --> 00:08:44,784
Okay, crack her open.

83
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:50,548
- Let me get around. Hang on.
- You getting it?

84
00:09:13,194 --> 00:09:15,071
Shit.

85
00:09:15,714 --> 00:09:17,432
No diamond.

86
00:09:17,514 --> 00:09:19,391
You know, boss,...

87
00:09:19,474 --> 00:09:24,468
..the same thing happened to Geraldo,
and his career never recovered.

88
00:09:26,234 --> 00:09:28,190
Turn the camera off.

89
00:09:28,274 --> 00:09:32,426
Brock, the partners would
like to know how it's going.

90
00:09:32,514 --> 00:09:36,302
Hey, Dave. Barry. Hi.
Look, it wasn't in the safe, but hey...

91
00:09:36,394 --> 00:09:40,273
..don't worry about it.
There's plenty of places it could be.

92
00:09:40,354 --> 00:09:42,424
The floor debris,
the mother's room...

93
00:09:42,514 --> 00:09:44,903
- Purser's safe on "C" deck.
- Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase.

94
00:09:44,994 --> 00:09:46,632
Brock: A dozen other places.

95
00:09:46,714 --> 00:09:49,911
You've got to trust my instincts.
I know we're close.

96
00:09:49,994 --> 00:09:53,430
We just got to go through
a process of elimination.

97
00:09:53,514 --> 00:09:55,505
Hang on a second.

98
00:09:57,474 --> 00:09:59,465
Let me see that.

99
00:09:59,514 --> 00:10:01,391
We might have something here, guys.

100
00:10:02,914 --> 00:10:05,508
Where's the photo of the necklace?

101
00:10:05,554 --> 00:10:08,193
- We'll call you right back.
- Holy...

102
00:10:17,754 --> 00:10:19,745

Brock!
There's a satellite call for you.

125
00:11:37,754 --> 00:11:41,588
Bobby, we're launching.
You see these submersibles going in?

126
00:11:41,674 --> 00:11:44,234
Trust me, buddy.
You wanna take this call.

127
00:11:45,474 --> 00:11:47,430
This better be good.

128
00:11:47,514 --> 00:11:50,472
You gotta speak up.
She's kinda old.

129
00:11:50,554 --> 00:11:52,306
Great.

130
00:11:52,394 --> 00:11:55,466
This is Brock Lovett.
How can I help you, Mrs...?

131
00:11:55,554 --> 00:11:57,670
Calvert. Rose Calvert.

132
00:11:57,754 --> 00:11:59,551
Mrs Calvert?

133
00:11:59,634 --> 00:12:04,788
I was just wondering if you'd found
the "Heart of the Ocean", Mr Lovett.

134
00:12:06,474 --> 00:12:08,704
I said you wanted to take the call.

135
00:12:10,754 --> 00:12:13,188
All right.
You have my attention, Rose.

136
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:16,186
Can you tell us who the woman
in the picture is?

137
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:17,787
Oh, yes.

138
00:12:17,874 --> 00:12:20,468
The woman in the picture is me.

139
00:12:35,434 --> 00:12:39,950
She's a goddamned liar! Some nutcase
seeking money or publicity!

140
00:12:40,034 --> 00:12:43,743
God only knows why!
Like that Russian babe, Anaesthesia!

141
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:45,825
They're inbound!

142
00:12:50,274 --> 00:12:53,869
Rose DeWitt Bukater died on Titanic
when she was 17.

143
00:12:53,954 --> 00:12:55,228
Right.

144
00:12:55,314 --> 00:12:57,782
If she'd lived, she'd be over 100 by now.

145
00:12:57,874 --> 00:13:00,183
101 next month.

146
00:13:00,274 --> 00:13:03,186
So she's a very old goddamned liar!

147
00:13:03,274 --> 00:13:06,107
I've done the background
on this woman...

148
00:13:06,194 --> 00:13:09,630
..back to the '20s
when she was working as an actress.

149
00:13:09,714 --> 00:13:11,147
An actress!

150
00:13:11,234 --> 00:13:15,193
There's your first clue, Sherlock!
Her name was Rose Dawson back then.

151
00:13:15,274 --> 00:13:20,507
She marries a guy named Calvert.
They move to Cedar Rapids and have kids.

152
00:13:20,594 --> 00:13:23,506
Now Calvert's dead,
and Cedar Rapids, too.

153
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,233
Everybody who knows
about the diamond...

154
00:13:26,314 --> 00:13:28,225
..is supposed to be dead
or on this boat, but she knows.

155
00:13:40,674 --> 00:13:43,552
Doesn't exactly travel light,
does she?

156
00:13:45,474 --> 00:13:47,544
Mrs Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.

157
00:13:47,634 --> 00:13:49,625
Welcome to the Keldysh.

158
00:13:51,154 --> 00:13:53,031
Let's get her inside.

159
00:13:53,074 --> 00:13:54,393
Hi, Ms Calvert.

160
00:13:54,474 --> 00:13:56,669
- Hi.
- Welcome to the Keldysh.

161
00:13:58,514 --> 00:13:59,993
Man: Hey.

162
00:14:00,074 --> 00:14:01,666
Hey!

163
00:14:06,074 --> 00:14:07,666
(Knocking)

164
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:08,703
Yes?

165
00:14:08,754 --> 00:14:11,587
- Are your staterooms all right?
- Very nice.

166
00:14:11,674 --> 00:14:14,632
Have you met my granddaughter Lizzy?

167
00:14:14,714 --> 00:14:16,670
She takes care of me.

168
00:14:16,754 --> 00:14:19,268
We met just a few minutes ago.

169
00:14:19,354 --> 00:14:21,788
Remember, Nana? Up on deck?

170
00:14:21,874 --> 00:14:24,308
Rose: There, that's nice.

171
00:14:24,394 --> 00:14:26,988
Have to have my pictures when I travel.

172
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,542
Is there anything you'd like?

173
00:14:31,154 --> 00:14:32,587
Yes.

174
00:14:32,674 --> 00:14:35,188
I would like to see my drawing.

175
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:52,587
Brock: Louis XVI wore a fabulous stone,
the Blue Diamond of the Crown,...

176
00:14:52,674 --> 00:14:55,586
..which disappeared in 1792.

177
00:14:55,674 --> 00:14:59,303
About that time old Louis
lost everything, from the neck up.

178
00:14:59,394 --> 00:15:03,831
The theory goes that
the Crown Diamond was chopped, too.

179
00:15:03,914 --> 00:15:07,987
Recut into a heart shape that became
known as "The Heart of the Ocean".

180
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,349
Today it'd be worth more
than the Hope Diamond.

181
00:15:10,434 --> 00:15:12,743
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.

182
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:15,587
I only wore it this once.

183
00:15:15,674 --> 00:15:17,869
You actually think this is you, Nana?

184
00:15:17,954 --> 00:15:19,831
It is me, dear.

185
00:15:19,914 --> 00:15:21,905
Wasn't I a dish?

186
00:15:23,274 --> 00:15:25,993
I tracked it down
through insurance records.

187
00:15:26,074 --> 00:15:29,703
An old claim that was settled
under terms of absolute secrecy.

188
00:15:29,794 --> 00:15:34,026
Can you tell me
who the claimant was, Rose?

189
00:15:34,114 --> 00:15:36,230
I imagine someone named Hockley.

190
00:15:36,314 --> 00:15:38,544
Nathan Hockley, that's right.

191
00:15:38,634 --> 00:15:40,590
Pittsburgh steel tycoon.

192
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:45,464
The claim was for a necklace his son
Caledon bought his fiancée - you -

193
00:15:45,554 --> 00:15:48,387
..a week before he sailed on Titanic.

194
00:15:48,474 --> 00:15:51,227
It was filed right after the sinking,...

195
00:15:51,314 --> 00:15:55,466
..so the diamond had to have
gone down with the ship.

196
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,905
You see the date?

197
00:15:59,554 --> 00:16:01,510
"April 14, 1912."

198
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:03,983
If your grandmother
is who she says she is,...

199
00:16:04,074 --> 00:16:06,952
..she was wearing the diamond
the day the Titanic sank.

200
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:10,390
And that makes you my new best friend.

201
00:16:10,474 --> 00:16:14,911
These are some of the things
we recovered from your stateroom.

202
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:18,825
This was mine!

203
00:16:19,594 --> 00:16:21,550
How extraordinary!

204
00:16:21,634 --> 00:16:25,627
And it looks the same as it did
the last time I saw it.

205
00:16:30,994 --> 00:16:33,383
The reflection has changed a bit.

206
00:16:49,434 --> 00:16:51,902
Are you ready to go back to Titanic?

207
00:16:55,234 --> 00:16:59,512
Okay, here we go. She hits the berg
on the starboard side, right?

208
00:16:59,594 --> 00:17:04,304
She bumps along, punching holes
along the side, below the waterline.

209
00:17:04,394 --> 00:17:07,989
Then the forward compartments
start to flood.

210
00:17:08,074 --> 00:17:11,191
As the water rises, it spills over
the watertight bulkheads...

211
00:17:11,274 --> 00:17:13,868
..which don't go any higher
than "E" deck.

212
00:17:13,954 --> 00:17:17,663
So now as the bow goes down,
the stern rises up,...

213
00:17:17,754 --> 00:17:20,109
..slow at first,
then faster and faster,...

214
00:17:20,194 --> 00:17:23,630
..until she's got her whole ass
up in the air. A big ass.

215
00:17:23,714 --> 00:17:27,229
We're talking 20,000, 30,000 tons, okay?

216
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:31,387
The hull's not designed to deal
with that pressure, so what happens?

217
00:17:31,474 --> 00:17:36,707
She splits, right down to the keel,
and the stern falls back level.

218
00:17:36,794 --> 00:17:39,547
As the bow sinks
it pulls the stern vertical...

219
00:17:39,634 --> 00:17:41,864
..and then finally detaches.

220
00:17:41,954 --> 00:17:46,391
The stern section bobs there
like a cork for a few minutes,...

221
00:17:46,474 --> 00:17:49,034
..floods, and finally goes under
about 2.20am.

222
00:17:49,114 --> 00:17:52,504
Two hours and 40 minutes
after the collision.

223
00:17:52,594 --> 00:17:57,110
The bow section planes away,
landing about half a mile away,...

224
00:17:57,194 --> 00:18:00,231
..going 20, 30 knots
when it hits the ocean floor.

225
00:18:02,794 --> 00:18:04,546
Pretty cool, huh?

226
00:18:04,634 --> 00:18:09,754
Thank you for that fine
forensic analysis, Mr Bodine.

227
00:18:09,834 --> 00:18:15,466
Of course, the experience of it was...
somewhat different.

228
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:17,988
Will you share it with us?

229
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:12,783
- I'm taking her to rest.
- No.

230
00:19:12,874 --> 00:19:14,865
- Come on, Nana.
- No!

231
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:21,265
Tape recorder.

232
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,585
Tell us, Rose.

233
00:19:26,674 --> 00:19:28,630
It's been 84 years.

234
00:19:28,714 --> 00:19:30,625
Try to remember anything.

235
00:19:30,714 --> 00:19:32,227
Anything at all.

236
00:19:32,314 --> 00:19:35,943
Do you want to hear this or not,
Mr Lovett?

237
00:19:39,954 --> 00:19:42,946
It's been 84 years...

238
00:19:43,674 --> 00:19:47,269
..and I can still smell the fresh paint.

239
00:19:49,274 --> 00:19:51,868
The china had never been used.

240
00:19:52,754 --> 00:19:55,222
The sheets had never been slept in.

241
00:19:56,794 --> 00:20:00,184
Titanic was called
"The Ship of Dreams".

242
00:20:02,074 --> 00:20:04,065
And it was.

243
00:20:04,194 --> 00:20:06,185
It really was.

244
00:20:33,474 --> 00:20:36,193
All third-class passengers...

245
00:20:36,274 --> 00:20:38,310
..with a forward berth,...

246
00:20:38,394 --> 00:20:41,466
..this way, please.
This queue. Right here.

247
00:20:41,554 --> 00:20:42,782
Big boat, uh?

248
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:45,104
- Daddy, it's a ship.
- You're right.

249
00:20:45,194 --> 00:20:47,185
(Car horn)

250
00:21:14,594 --> 00:21:18,951
Why all the fuss? It doesn't look
any bigger than the Mauretania.

251
00:21:19,034 --> 00:21:22,868
You can be blasé about some things,
Rose, but not about Titanic.

252
00:21:22,954 --> 00:21:24,546
It's 100 feet longer...

253
00:21:24,634 --> 00:21:26,590
..and far more luxurious.

254
00:21:26,674 --> 00:21:29,586
Your daughter is difficult
to impress, Ruth.

255
00:21:29,674 --> 00:21:32,552
So this is the ship
they say is unsinkable.

256
00:21:32,634 --> 00:21:35,194
God himself could not sink this ship.

257
00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:38,869
Sir, you have to check your baggage
through the main terminal.

258
00:21:38,954 --> 00:21:42,185
I put my faith in you, good sir.
Now kindly see my man.

259
00:21:42,274 --> 00:21:44,230
Yes, sir. My pleasure, sir.

260
00:21:44,314 --> 00:21:45,463
Right.

261
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,193
All the trunks from that car there,...

262
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:51,505
..12 from here, and the safe,...

263
00:21:51,594 --> 00:21:54,347
..to the Parlour Suite, rooms B52, 54, 56.

264
00:21:54,434 --> 00:21:55,833
(Whistle)

265
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:57,870
Ladies...

266
00:21:57,954 --> 00:21:59,592
Better hurry.

267
00:22:04,354 --> 00:22:06,822
- My coat?
- I have it, miss.

268
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:12,824
All third-class passengers
queue here for health inspection.

269
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,233
Chin up.

270
00:22:18,954 --> 00:22:22,708
Welcome aboard, ma'am.
Welcome to Titanic.

271
00:22:22,794 --> 00:22:26,184
Rose: <i>It was the ship</i>
<i>of dreams to everyone else.</i>

272
00:22:27,114 --> 00:22:29,674
<i>To me it was a slave ship...</i>

273
00:22:29,754 --> 00:22:33,349
<i>..taking me back to America in chains.</i>

274
00:22:33,434 --> 00:22:37,791
<i>Outwardly I was everything</i>
<i>a well-brought-up girl should be.</i>

275
00:22:37,874 --> 00:22:40,183
<i>Inside, I was screaming.</i>

276
00:22:40,274 --> 00:22:41,992
(Steam whistle)

277
00:22:52,474 --> 00:22:54,465
(Speaking Swedish)

278
00:22:55,754 --> 00:22:58,985
Jack, you are pazzo.
You bet everything we have.

279
00:22:59,074 --> 00:23:02,191
When you got nothing,
you got nothing to lose.

280
00:23:03,634 --> 00:23:08,230
Swedish: You moron.
I can't believe you bet our tickets.

281
00:23:09,034 --> 00:23:10,023
Sven?

282
00:23:30,794 --> 00:23:33,308
All right... moment of truth.

283
00:23:33,674 --> 00:23:36,188
Somebody's life's about to change.

284
00:23:36,274 --> 00:23:37,229
Fabrizio?

285
00:23:39,234 --> 00:23:40,223
Niente.

286
00:23:40,274 --> 00:23:41,309
Niente.

287
00:23:42,794 --> 00:23:44,386
Olaf?

288
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:45,743
Nothing.

289
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:47,426
Sven?

290
00:23:49,714 --> 00:23:52,308
Uh-oh. Two pair.

291
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,470
I'm sorry, Fabrizio.

292
00:23:54,554 --> 00:23:56,829
"Sorry"? You bet all the money!

293
00:23:56,914 --> 00:24:00,623
I'm sorry. You're not gonna see
your mom for a long time.

294
00:24:00,714 --> 00:24:03,990
Cos we're going to America!
Full house, boys!

295
00:24:04,074 --> 00:24:05,587
Whoa!

296
00:24:05,674 --> 00:24:06,948
Yeah!

297
00:24:07,034 --> 00:24:09,070
Dio mio, grazie!

298
00:24:10,674 --> 00:24:12,983
(Cursing in Swedish)

299
00:24:16,274 --> 00:24:17,866
Come on!

300
00:24:17,954 --> 00:24:19,148
Figlio di puttana!

301
00:24:19,234 --> 00:24:20,906
I'm going home!

302
00:24:20,994 --> 00:24:22,985
(Cursing in Swedish)

303
00:24:23,634 --> 00:24:24,828
I'm going home!

304
00:24:24,914 --> 00:24:26,870
I go to America!

305
00:24:26,954 --> 00:24:28,103
No, mate.

306
00:24:28,194 --> 00:24:30,913
Titanic go to America, in five minutes.

307
00:24:32,034 --> 00:24:34,389
Come on! Come on, here!

308
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:36,544
Andiamo!

309
00:24:36,634 --> 00:24:40,309
We're riding in high style now!
We're a couple of swells!

310
00:24:40,394 --> 00:24:43,192
Practically goddamn royalty,
ragazzo mio!

311
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:46,186
You see, it's my destino!

312
00:24:46,274 --> 00:24:48,663
I go to America to be millionario!

313
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:50,312
Driver: Whoa! Whoa!

314
00:24:50,394 --> 00:24:51,986
Bastardo!

315
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:56,192
- You're pazzo!
- Maybe, but I've got the tickets!

316
00:24:56,274 --> 00:24:58,469
Come on, I thought you were fast!

317
00:24:58,554 --> 00:25:02,593
- Aspetta!
- Wait! Hey, wait!

318
00:25:02,674 --> 00:25:05,063
We're passengers! Passengers!

319
00:25:05,914 --> 00:25:09,190
- Have you been through the inspection?
- Of course!

320
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:12,107
Anyway, we don't have lice.
We're Americans.

321
00:25:12,194 --> 00:25:14,992
Right. Come aboard.

322
00:25:17,834 --> 00:25:21,031
We're the luckiest sons of bitches
in the world!

323
00:25:21,234 --> 00:25:23,828
(Ship's horn)

324
00:25:29,074 --> 00:25:30,712
Goodbye!

325
00:25:34,754 --> 00:25:37,314
- You know somebody?
- That's not the point.

326
00:25:37,394 --> 00:25:41,865
- Goodbye! I'll miss you!
- Goodbye! I will never forget you!

327
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:44,110
(Crowd cheering)

328
00:26:28,434 --> 00:26:30,425
Go left, darling.

329
00:26:35,114 --> 00:26:36,866
G60, G60...

330
00:26:36,954 --> 00:26:38,945
Excuse me, ma'am.

331
00:26:41,114 --> 00:26:43,105
Oh, right here.

332
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:46,625
Hey, how you doing?
Jack. Nice to meet you.

333
00:26:46,714 --> 00:26:50,468
I'm Jack Dawson. Nice to meet you.
How you doing?

334
00:26:50,554 --> 00:26:53,022
Who says you get top bunk, huh?

335
00:26:54,634 --> 00:26:56,590
Swedish: Where's Sven?

336
00:26:56,674 --> 00:27:01,873
This is your private deck, sir.
Would you be requiring anything?

337
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,865
- Mm-mm.
- Excuse me.

338
00:27:03,954 --> 00:27:08,470
- This one?
- No... It had a lot of faces on it.

339
00:27:08,554 --> 00:27:10,545
This is the one.

340
00:27:11,074 --> 00:27:13,634
Would you like all of them out, miss?

341
00:27:13,714 --> 00:27:16,786
Yes... We need a little colour
in this room.

342
00:27:19,114 --> 00:27:21,548
Put it in there, in the wardrobe.

343
00:27:21,634 --> 00:27:24,512
God, not those finger paintings again!

344
00:27:24,594 --> 00:27:25,993
Waste of money!

345
00:27:26,074 --> 00:27:28,110
The difference between Cal's taste
and mine...

346
00:27:28,194 --> 00:27:30,913
..is that I have some.
They're fascinating.

347
00:27:30,994 --> 00:27:34,111
Like being inside a dream
or something.

348
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,991
There's truth, but no logic.

349
00:27:36,074 --> 00:27:39,032
- What's the artist's name?
- Something Picasso.

350
00:27:39,114 --> 00:27:43,027
"Something Picasso".
He won't amount to a thing. Trust me.

351
00:27:43,114 --> 00:27:46,663
- Put the Degas in the bedroom.
- At least they were cheap.

352
00:27:46,754 --> 00:27:48,745
Put it in the wardrobe.

353
00:27:53,274 --> 00:27:57,233
Rose: <i>At Cherbourg, a woman</i>
<i>came aboard named Margaret Brown.</i>

354
00:27:57,314 --> 00:27:59,225
<i>We all called her Molly.</i>

355
00:27:59,314 --> 00:28:03,193
<i>History would call her</i>
<i>"The Unsinkable Molly Brown".</i>

356
00:28:03,274 --> 00:28:07,665
I wasn't about to wait all day, sonny.
Here, think you can manage?

357
00:28:07,754 --> 00:28:11,190
<i>Her husband had struck gold</i>
<i>someplace out west...</i>

358
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:14,471
<i>..and she was what Mother called</i>
<i>"new money".</i>

359
00:28:14,554 --> 00:28:18,752
<i>By next afternoon we were steaming</i>
<i>west from the coast of Ireland...</i>

360
00:28:18,834 --> 00:28:22,827
<i>..with nothing out ahead of us but ocean.</i>

361
00:28:28,834 --> 00:28:31,871
Take her to sea, Mr Murdoch.

362
00:28:31,954 --> 00:28:34,866
- Let's stretch her legs.
- Yes, sir.

363
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:39,786
- All ahead full, Mr Moody.
- Very good, sir.

364
00:28:40,274 --> 00:28:42,026
(Bells ringing)

365
00:28:44,274 --> 00:28:45,502
All ahead full.

366
00:28:45,594 --> 00:28:47,744
Man: All ahead full!

367
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:49,825
Come on, lads. Step lively.

368
00:29:07,354 --> 00:29:10,710
Let's stoke them right up!
We're going full ahead!

369
00:30:04,994 --> 00:30:06,985
21 knots, sir.

370
00:30:14,954 --> 00:30:17,514
Hey, look, look, look!
Look, look!

371
00:30:19,754 --> 00:30:21,187
See it?

372
00:30:24,354 --> 00:30:26,424
There's another one! See him?

373
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:37,512
Look at that one!

374
00:30:37,594 --> 00:30:39,505
Look at him jump!

375
00:30:39,594 --> 00:30:40,310
Whoo-hoo!

376
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,952
Whoo!

377
00:31:03,594 --> 00:31:06,154
I can see the Statue of Liberty
already!

378
00:31:06,234 --> 00:31:07,986
Very small, of course.

379
00:31:10,354 --> 00:31:14,188
I'm the king of the world!

380
00:31:14,274 --> 00:31:15,946
(Whooping and yelling)

381
00:31:57,994 --> 00:32:00,713
She is the largest moving object
ever made by the hand of man...

382
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:02,591
..in all history.

383
00:32:02,674 --> 00:32:05,632
Our master shipbuilder,
Mr Andrews,...

384
00:32:05,714 --> 00:32:07,193
..designed her.

385
00:32:07,274 --> 00:32:09,071
I knocked her together...

386
00:32:09,154 --> 00:32:11,543
..but the idea was Mr Ismay's.

387
00:32:11,634 --> 00:32:14,910
He envisioned a steamer
so grand in scale...

388
00:32:14,994 --> 00:32:18,191
..that its supremacy
would never be challenged.

389
00:32:18,274 --> 00:32:19,787
And here she is...

390
00:32:19,874 --> 00:32:21,944
..willed into solid reality.

391
00:32:22,034 --> 00:32:23,945
Hear, hear.

392
00:32:24,034 --> 00:32:25,945
Salmon.

393
00:32:28,794 --> 00:32:32,309
You know I don't like that, Rose.

394
00:32:34,394 --> 00:32:36,305
She knows.

395
00:32:37,634 --> 00:32:42,071
We'll both have the lamb, rare,
with very little mint sauce.

396
00:32:42,154 --> 00:32:44,622
You like lamb, right, sweet pea?

397
00:32:46,394 --> 00:32:49,306
Are you gonna cut her meat
for her, too, Cal?

398
00:32:52,154 --> 00:32:56,147
Hey, who thought of the name
"Titanic"? Was it you, Bruce?

399
00:32:56,234 --> 00:32:57,713
Yes, actually.

400
00:32:57,794 --> 00:33:02,504
I wanted to convey sheer size,
and the size means stability,...

401
00:33:02,594 --> 00:33:06,553
..luxury, and, above all, strength.

402
00:33:06,634 --> 00:33:09,068
Do you know of Dr Freud, Mr Ismay?

403
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:13,432
His ideas about male preoccupation
with size might interest you.

404
00:33:14,754 --> 00:33:18,144
- What's gotten into you?
- Excuse me.

405
00:33:21,314 --> 00:33:23,225
I do apologise.

406
00:33:23,394 --> 00:33:25,510
She's a pistol, Cal.
Hope you can handle her.

407
00:33:25,594 --> 00:33:29,906
Well, I may have to start minding
what she reads, Mrs Brown.

408
00:33:29,994 --> 00:33:33,350
Freud... who is he?
Is he a passenger?

409
00:33:34,434 --> 00:33:37,471
..turns the propeller,...

410
00:33:37,554 --> 00:33:39,545
..makes these waves,...

411
00:33:40,114 --> 00:33:42,105
..makes them spin.

412
00:33:45,114 --> 00:33:47,548
Fabrizio: The ship is nice, uh?

413
00:33:47,634 --> 00:33:50,546
- Yeah, it's an Irish ship.
- Is English, no?

414
00:33:50,634 --> 00:33:54,991
No, it was built in Ireland.
15,000 Irishmen built this ship.

415
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,666
That's typical.

416
00:33:56,754 --> 00:34:00,463
First-class dogs come down here
to take a shite.

417
00:34:00,554 --> 00:34:02,510
It lets us know where we rank.

418
00:34:02,594 --> 00:34:04,585
Like we could forget?

419
00:34:05,114 --> 00:34:07,070
I'm Tommy Ryan.

420
00:34:07,154 --> 00:34:09,429
- Jack Dawson.
- Fabrizio.

421
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:13,587
Hi. Do you make any money
with your drawings?

422
00:34:22,194 --> 00:34:27,268
Oh, forget it, boyo. You'd as like
have angels fly out of your arse...

423
00:34:27,354 --> 00:34:29,743
..as get next to the likes of her.

424
00:34:51,234 --> 00:34:55,386
Rose: <i>I saw my whole life</i>
<i>as if I'd already lived it,...</i>

425
00:34:55,474 --> 00:34:59,149
<i>..an endless parade of parties</i>
<i>and cotillions,...</i>

426
00:34:59,234 --> 00:35:01,225
<i>..yachts and polo matches.</i>

427
00:35:01,994 --> 00:35:06,704
<i>Always the same narrow people,</i>
<i>the same mindless chatter.</i>

428
00:35:06,794 --> 00:35:10,753
<i>I felt like I was standing</i>
<i>at a great precipice...</i>

429
00:35:10,834 --> 00:35:13,394
<i>..with no-one to pull me back.</i>

430
00:35:13,474 --> 00:35:17,626
<i>No-one who cared, or even noticed.</i>

431
00:35:25,274 --> 00:35:27,265
(Rose sobbing)

432
00:35:46,714 --> 00:35:48,705
(Rose running and sobbing)

433
00:37:02,714 --> 00:37:04,033
Don't do it.

434
00:37:04,114 --> 00:37:06,025
Stay back.

435
00:37:06,114 --> 00:37:08,230
Don't come any closer.

436
00:37:08,994 --> 00:37:10,950
Come on.

437
00:37:11,034 --> 00:37:13,946
- Gimme your hand. I'll pull you back.
- No!

438
00:37:14,034 --> 00:37:16,309
Stay where you are. I mean it.

439
00:37:17,274 --> 00:37:19,265
I'll let go.

440
00:37:28,434 --> 00:37:30,425
No, you won't.

441
00:37:31,434 --> 00:37:34,187
What do you mean, no, I won't?

442
00:37:34,274 --> 00:37:37,869
Don't presume to tell me
what I will and will not do.

443
00:37:37,954 --> 00:37:39,910
Well, you would've done it already.

444
00:37:39,994 --> 00:37:42,462
You're distracting me. Go away.

445
00:37:42,554 --> 00:37:44,033
I can't.

446
00:37:44,114 --> 00:37:46,344
I'm involved now.

447
00:37:46,434 --> 00:37:50,222
You let go and I'm gonna
have to jump in there after you.

448
00:37:51,434 --> 00:37:54,187
Don't be absurd. You'll be killed.

449
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:57,903
- I'm a good swimmer.
- The fall alone would kill you.

450
00:37:57,994 --> 00:38:01,304
It would hurt.
I'm not saying it wouldn't.

451
00:38:01,394 --> 00:38:05,353
But I'm more concerned
about that water being so cold.

452
00:38:11,434 --> 00:38:13,231
How cold?

453
00:38:13,314 --> 00:38:16,624
Freezing.
Maybe a couple of degrees over.

454
00:38:19,914 --> 00:38:22,109
You ever, uh...

455
00:38:22,194 --> 00:38:24,424
..ever been to Wisconsin?

456
00:38:26,834 --> 00:38:28,153
What?

457
00:38:28,234 --> 00:38:30,623
They have some of the coldest winters.

458
00:38:30,714 --> 00:38:33,751
I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls.

459
00:38:33,834 --> 00:38:37,588
When I was a kid,
me and my father went ice fishing...

460
00:38:37,674 --> 00:38:39,551
..out on Lake Wissota.

461
00:38:39,634 --> 00:38:41,511
Ice fishing is where you...

462
00:38:41,594 --> 00:38:43,824
I know what ice fishing is!

463
00:38:43,914 --> 00:38:45,711
Sorry.

464
00:38:46,794 --> 00:38:50,469
You just seem like, you know,
kind of an indoor girl.

465
00:38:52,274 --> 00:38:54,424
Anyway, I, uh...

466
00:38:54,514 --> 00:38:56,789
I fell through some thin ice.

467
00:38:56,874 --> 00:38:59,468
And I'm telling you...

468
00:38:59,554 --> 00:39:02,751
..water that cold,
like right down there,...

469
00:39:02,834 --> 00:39:06,713
..it hits you like a thousand knives
stabbing you all over.

470
00:39:06,794 --> 00:39:09,388
You can't breathe...

471
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:12,345
You can't think...

472
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:14,994
At least not about anything
but the pain.

473
00:39:16,474 --> 00:39:21,150
Which is why I'm not looking forward
to jumping in there after you.

474
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:22,826
Like I said,...

475
00:39:24,594 --> 00:39:26,585
..I don't have a choice.

476
00:39:30,154 --> 00:39:34,909
I'm hoping you'll come back
over the rail and get me off the hook here.

477
00:39:34,994 --> 00:39:36,985
You're crazy.

478
00:39:37,514 --> 00:39:40,074
That's what everybody says, but...

479
00:39:40,634 --> 00:39:45,708
With all due respect, miss, I'm not the one
hanging off the back of a ship.

480
00:39:45,794 --> 00:39:47,750
Come on.

481
00:39:47,834 --> 00:39:50,553
Come on, gimme your hand.

482
00:39:50,634 --> 00:39:53,467
You don't wanna do this.

483
00:40:05,034 --> 00:40:06,626
Whew!

484
00:40:07,034 --> 00:40:08,990
I'm Jack Dawson.

485
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:10,951
Rose DeWitt Bukater.

486
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:13,594
I'll have to get you
to write that down!

487
00:40:15,754 --> 00:40:17,312
Come on.

488
00:40:19,514 --> 00:40:20,947
(Screams)

489
00:40:22,034 --> 00:40:24,912
I got you! Come on!

490
00:40:24,994 --> 00:40:26,950
Come on!

491
00:40:28,914 --> 00:40:30,313
(Screams)

492
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:31,747
Help! Please!

493
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:33,825
Help! Please!

494
00:40:35,074 --> 00:40:37,634
- Please help me!
- Listen! Listen to me!

495
00:40:37,714 --> 00:40:39,386
I've got you. I won't let go.

496
00:40:39,474 --> 00:40:41,669
Now pull yourself up. Come on!

497
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:45,144
Come on.

498
00:40:45,194 --> 00:40:46,673
That's right.

499
00:40:46,754 --> 00:40:49,143
You can do it.

500
00:40:52,994 --> 00:40:54,393
I got you.

501
00:40:59,154 --> 00:41:02,112
What's all this?

502
00:41:06,754 --> 00:41:10,110
You stand back!
And don't move an inch!

503
00:41:11,034 --> 00:41:12,990
Fetch the master-at-arms!

504
00:41:13,074 --> 00:41:15,030
Care for a brandy?

505
00:41:15,114 --> 00:41:17,753
Cal: This is completely unacceptable!

506
00:41:17,834 --> 00:41:21,065
How dare you put your hands
on my fiancée!

507
00:41:21,154 --> 00:41:23,384
- Look at me, you filth!
- Cal...

508
00:41:23,474 --> 00:41:27,831
- What do you think you were doing?
- Cal, stop! It was an accident.

509
00:41:27,914 --> 00:41:29,791
An accident?

510
00:41:29,874 --> 00:41:31,307
It was.

511
00:41:31,394 --> 00:41:33,464
Stupid, really.

512
00:41:33,554 --> 00:41:36,626
I was leaning over and I slipped.

513
00:41:38,114 --> 00:41:42,551
I was leaning far over to see the, uh...

514
00:41:42,634 --> 00:41:43,987
..uh...

515
00:41:44,074 --> 00:41:45,063
..the, uh...

516
00:41:45,154 --> 00:41:48,112
- Propellers?
- Propellers. And I slipped.

517
00:41:48,194 --> 00:41:52,346
I would have gone overboard,
but Mr Dawson here saved me...

518
00:41:52,434 --> 00:41:55,028
..and almost went over himself.

519
00:41:55,114 --> 00:41:59,505
- She wanted to see the propellers!
- Women and machinery do not mix.

520
00:41:59,594 --> 00:42:02,791
Was that the way of it?

521
00:42:04,074 --> 00:42:06,588
Yeah. Yeah, that was pretty much it.

522
00:42:06,674 --> 00:42:10,269
The boy's a hero, then.
Good for you, son. Well done.

523
00:42:10,354 --> 00:42:12,424
So it's all's well, and, uh...

524
00:42:12,514 --> 00:42:14,470
..back to our brandy, eh?

525
00:42:14,554 --> 00:42:18,547
Look at you. You must be freezing.
Let's get you inside.

526
00:42:18,634 --> 00:42:21,068
Perhaps a little something for the boy?

527
00:42:23,034 --> 00:42:24,433
Of course.

528
00:42:24,514 --> 00:42:27,506
Mr Lovejoy, I think a 20 should do it.

529
00:42:27,634 --> 00:42:31,229
Is that the going rate
for saving the woman you love?

530
00:42:32,834 --> 00:42:35,507
Rose is displeased. What to do...

531
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:37,982
I know.

532
00:42:39,834 --> 00:42:43,907
Perhaps you could join us
for dinner tomorrow evening...

533
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:47,430
..to regale our group with...
your heroic tale.

534
00:42:50,314 --> 00:42:52,191
Sure. Count me in.

535
00:42:52,274 --> 00:42:55,186
Good. Settled, then.

536
00:42:55,274 --> 00:42:58,391
- This should be interesting.
- Mmm.

537
00:43:02,234 --> 00:43:03,303
(Whistles)

538
00:43:05,994 --> 00:43:08,383
Can I, uh... bum a smoke?

539
00:43:15,834 --> 00:43:18,109
You'll want to tie those.

540
00:43:20,554 --> 00:43:22,112
It's interesting.

541
00:43:22,194 --> 00:43:24,549
The young lady slips so suddenly...

542
00:43:24,634 --> 00:43:29,310
..and you still had time to remove
your jacket and your shoes.

543
00:43:33,954 --> 00:43:35,433
(Music box)

544
00:43:35,474 --> 00:43:37,032
(Knock at door)

545
00:43:43,034 --> 00:43:45,229
I know you've been melancholy.

546
00:43:46,074 --> 00:43:48,065
I don't pretend to know why.

547
00:43:50,514 --> 00:43:52,630
I intended to save this...

548
00:43:52,714 --> 00:43:55,672
..until the engagement gala...

549
00:43:56,234 --> 00:43:58,225
..next week.

550
00:43:58,674 --> 00:44:01,029
But... I thought...

551
00:44:01,114 --> 00:44:02,706
..tonight.

552
00:44:03,754 --> 00:44:05,745
Good gracious!

553
00:44:05,834 --> 00:44:07,870
A reminder of my feelings for you.

554
00:44:07,954 --> 00:44:09,228
Is it a...?

555
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:11,066
Diamond? Yes.

556
00:44:13,434 --> 00:44:15,425
56 carats to be exact.

557
00:44:18,314 --> 00:44:23,832
It was worn by Louis XVI,
and they called it "Le Cœur de la Mer".

558
00:44:23,914 --> 00:44:26,508
Both: The Heart of the Ocean.

559
00:44:31,874 --> 00:44:33,830
It's overwhelming.

560
00:44:33,914 --> 00:44:35,905
Well, it's for royalty.

561
00:44:36,834 --> 00:44:38,825
We are royalty, Rose.

562
00:44:42,234 --> 00:44:45,704
You know, there's nothing
I couldn't give you.

563
00:44:45,794 --> 00:44:48,467
There's nothing I'd deny you...

564
00:44:48,954 --> 00:44:51,343
..if you would not deny me.

565
00:44:53,714 --> 00:44:56,353
Oh, open your heart to me, Rose.

566
00:45:11,714 --> 00:45:16,310
Jack: Well, I've been on my own
since I was 15, since my folks died.

567
00:45:16,394 --> 00:45:20,353
I had no close kin
in that part of the country.

568
00:45:20,434 --> 00:45:23,506
So I left and I haven't been back since.

569
00:45:23,594 --> 00:45:27,587
You could just call me a tumbleweed
blowing in the wind.

570
00:45:28,034 --> 00:45:32,312
Well, Rose, we've walked about a mile
around this boat deck...

571
00:45:32,394 --> 00:45:36,706
..and chewed over how great
the weather's been and how I grew up,...

572
00:45:36,794 --> 00:45:41,185
..but I reckon that's not
why you came to talk to me, is it?

573
00:45:41,274 --> 00:45:43,993
- Mr Dawson, I...
- Jack.

574
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,553
Jack.

575
00:45:45,634 --> 00:45:48,102
I want to thank you for what you did.

576
00:45:48,914 --> 00:45:53,226
Not just for... for pulling me back,
but for your discretion.

577
00:45:53,314 --> 00:45:55,032
You're welcome.

578
00:45:55,114 --> 00:45:58,823
Look, I know what
you must be thinking.

579
00:46:00,194 --> 00:46:02,150
Poor little rich girl.

580
00:46:02,234 --> 00:46:04,543
What does she know about misery?

581
00:46:04,634 --> 00:46:07,467
No... No, that's not what I was thinking.

582
00:46:07,554 --> 00:46:11,149
I was thinking
what could have happened to this girl...

583
00:46:11,234 --> 00:46:13,873
..to make her think she had no way out.

584
00:46:15,674 --> 00:46:17,471
Well, I...

585
00:46:17,874 --> 00:46:21,230
It was everything.
It was my whole world...

586
00:46:21,314 --> 00:46:23,225
..and all the people in it.

587
00:46:23,314 --> 00:46:27,910
The inertia of my life... plunging
ahead, and me powerless to stop it.

588
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:30,349
God! Look at that thing!

589
00:46:30,434 --> 00:46:33,267
You would've gone
straight to the bottom.

590
00:46:33,354 --> 00:46:35,948
500 invitations have gone out.

591
00:46:36,234 --> 00:46:39,829
All of Philadelphia society
will be there,...

592
00:46:39,914 --> 00:46:43,429
..and all the while I feel
I'm standing in a crowded room...

593
00:46:43,514 --> 00:46:46,984
..screaming at the top of my lungs,
and no-one even looks up.

594
00:46:47,634 --> 00:46:49,545
Do you love him?

595
00:46:50,634 --> 00:46:52,352
Pardon me?

596
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:54,425
Do you love him?

597
00:46:54,514 --> 00:46:57,028
You shouldn't be asking me this.

598
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:59,833
It's a simple question.
Do you love the guy or not?

599
00:47:01,554 --> 00:47:05,672
- This is not a suitable conversation.
- Can't you just answer the question?

600
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:11,788
This is absurd. You don't know me
and I don't know you,...

601
00:47:11,874 --> 00:47:14,946
..and we are not having this conversation.

602
00:47:15,034 --> 00:47:18,390
You are rude and uncouth
and... I am leaving now.

603
00:47:18,474 --> 00:47:21,272
Jack... Mr Dawson,
it's been a pleasure.

604
00:47:21,354 --> 00:47:23,743
I sought you out to thank you...

605
00:47:23,834 --> 00:47:27,270
- And you insulted me.
- You deserved it.

606
00:47:27,354 --> 00:47:29,345
- Right.
- Right.

607
00:47:31,674 --> 00:47:34,552
- I thought you were leaving.
- I am.

608
00:47:35,674 --> 00:47:37,665
You are so annoying!

609
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:39,267
Wait.

610
00:47:39,354 --> 00:47:42,949
I don't have to leave.
This is my part of the ship.

611
00:47:43,034 --> 00:47:44,786
You leave.

612
00:47:44,874 --> 00:47:48,310
Well, well, well!
Now who's being rude?

613
00:47:51,354 --> 00:47:55,347
What is this stupid thing
you're carrying around?

614
00:47:55,474 --> 00:47:58,671
So what are you?
An artist or something?

615
00:47:59,274 --> 00:48:02,789
Well... these are rather good.

616
00:48:06,034 --> 00:48:09,344
They're, uh...
they're very good, actually.

617
00:48:16,594 --> 00:48:19,108
Jack, this is exquisite work.

618
00:48:19,194 --> 00:48:22,709
- They didn't like them in old Paris.
- Paris?!

619
00:48:22,794 --> 00:48:26,423
You do get around, for a poor...

620
00:48:27,514 --> 00:48:31,473
Well, uh, uh,
a person of limited means.

621
00:48:31,554 --> 00:48:33,784
A poor guy. You can say it.

622
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:38,426
Well, well, well!

623
00:48:41,674 --> 00:48:43,949
And these were drawn from life?

624
00:48:47,234 --> 00:48:49,543
That's the good thing about Paris.

625
00:48:49,634 --> 00:48:53,229
Lots of girls
willing to take their clothes off.

626
00:48:56,834 --> 00:48:58,825
You liked this woman.

627
00:48:58,914 --> 00:49:01,428
You used her several times.

628
00:49:02,474 --> 00:49:06,945
Well, she had beautiful hands,
you see?

629
00:49:07,034 --> 00:49:10,231
I think you must have had
a love affair with her.

630
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:11,303
No, no, no.

631
00:49:11,394 --> 00:49:13,624
Just with her hands.

632
00:49:13,714 --> 00:49:16,148
She was a one-legged prostitute.

633
00:49:16,234 --> 00:49:17,713
See?

634
00:49:20,914 --> 00:49:22,711
Oh!

635
00:49:23,554 --> 00:49:26,387
She had a good sense of humour,
though.

636
00:49:28,234 --> 00:49:29,826
And this lady...

637
00:49:29,914 --> 00:49:34,544
She used to sit at this bar
every night...

638
00:49:34,634 --> 00:49:38,627
..wearing all her jewellery,
waiting for her long-lost love.

639
00:49:39,834 --> 00:49:41,950
Called her Madame Bijoux.

640
00:49:42,034 --> 00:49:45,663
See how her clothes
are all moth-eaten?

641
00:49:45,754 --> 00:49:48,632
Well, you have a gift, Jack.

642
00:49:48,714 --> 00:49:50,147
You do.

643
00:49:50,234 --> 00:49:51,587
You see people.

644
00:49:51,674 --> 00:49:53,790
I see you.

645
00:49:55,674 --> 00:49:57,107
And?

646
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:59,867
You wouldn't have jumped.

647
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:08,146
But the purpose of university
is to find a suitable husband.

648
00:50:08,234 --> 00:50:10,145
Rose has already done that.

649
00:50:10,234 --> 00:50:12,907
Here comes that vulgar Brown woman.

650
00:50:12,994 --> 00:50:15,633
Quickly, get up before she sits with us.

651
00:50:15,714 --> 00:50:17,067
Hello, girls.

652
00:50:17,154 --> 00:50:21,147
- I was hoping I'd catch you at tea.
- We're awfully sorry you missed it.

653
00:50:21,234 --> 00:50:23,953
The Countess and I
were just off to the boat deck.

654
00:50:24,034 --> 00:50:26,992
What a lovely idea.
I need to catch up on my gossip.

655
00:50:30,034 --> 00:50:31,831
Countess.

656
00:50:33,034 --> 00:50:36,151
So you've not yet lit
the last four boilers?

657
00:50:36,234 --> 00:50:39,351
I don't see the need.
We are making excellent time.

658
00:50:39,434 --> 00:50:41,994
The press knows the size of Titanic.

659
00:50:42,234 --> 00:50:45,306
Now I want them to marvel at her speed.

660
00:50:45,394 --> 00:50:48,386
We must give them
something new to print.

661
00:50:49,034 --> 00:50:51,468
This maiden voyage of Titanic...

662
00:50:51,554 --> 00:50:53,465
..must make headlines.

663
00:50:53,554 --> 00:50:57,229
Mr Ismay, I would prefer
not to push the engines...

664
00:50:57,314 --> 00:50:59,987
..until they've been properly run in.

665
00:51:00,074 --> 00:51:05,307
Of course, I'm just a passenger.
I leave it to you to decide what's best.

666
00:51:05,394 --> 00:51:09,467
But a glorious end to your final trip
if we arrive on Tuesday night...

667
00:51:09,554 --> 00:51:12,273
..and surprise them all.
Make the morning papers.

668
00:51:12,354 --> 00:51:14,822
Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?

669
00:51:17,594 --> 00:51:19,585
Good man.

670
00:51:20,434 --> 00:51:24,109
Well, after that I worked
on a squid boat in Monterey.

671
00:51:24,194 --> 00:51:26,628
Then I went to the pier
in Santa Monica...

672
00:51:26,714 --> 00:51:30,627
..and started doing portraits there
for 10 cents apiece.

673
00:51:30,674 --> 00:51:34,553
Why can't I be like you, Jack?
Just head out for the horizon...

674
00:51:34,634 --> 00:51:36,625
..whenever I feel like it.

675
00:51:37,354 --> 00:51:40,391
Say we'll go there sometime to that pier...

676
00:51:40,474 --> 00:51:42,510
..even if we only just talk about it.

677
00:51:42,594 --> 00:51:44,152
No, we'll do it.

678
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:47,431
We'll drink cheap beer.
Ride on the roller coaster.

679
00:51:47,514 --> 00:51:50,426
Then we'll ride horses on the beach...

680
00:51:50,514 --> 00:51:54,905
..right in the surf. But like a real cowboy.
Not that sidesaddle stuff.

681
00:51:56,474 --> 00:51:58,465
You mean, one leg on each side?

682
00:51:58,554 --> 00:51:59,953
Yeah.

683
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:03,310
- Can you show me?
- Sure. If you like.

684
00:52:04,314 --> 00:52:07,943
- Teach me to ride like a man.
- And chew tobacco like a man.

685
00:52:09,354 --> 00:52:11,584
And spit like a man!

686
00:52:11,674 --> 00:52:13,392
They didn't teach you that?

687
00:52:13,474 --> 00:52:14,873
No!

688
00:52:14,954 --> 00:52:16,910
Come on, I'll show you.

689
00:52:16,994 --> 00:52:19,064
I'll show you how. Come on.

690
00:52:19,154 --> 00:52:21,873
Jack! No! Jack! No!

691
00:52:21,954 --> 00:52:24,024
Wait, Jack. No, Jack.

692
00:52:24,114 --> 00:52:27,345
- I couldn't possibly, Jack.
- Watch closely.

693
00:52:28,674 --> 00:52:31,313
- That's disgusting!
- Your turn.

694
00:52:33,834 --> 00:52:35,108
Pitiful!

695
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:39,631
You really gotta hawk it back.
Use your arms. Arc your neck.

696
00:52:40,634 --> 00:52:43,194
See the range on that thing?

697
00:52:43,274 --> 00:52:45,469
Jack: Okay, go.

698
00:52:48,474 --> 00:52:53,423
You gotta work on it. Really try
and hawk it up and get some body to it.

699
00:52:53,514 --> 00:52:54,629
(Snorting)

700
00:53:00,874 --> 00:53:02,671
Mother.

701
00:53:07,154 --> 00:53:09,588
May I introduce Jack Dawson?

702
00:53:09,674 --> 00:53:11,665
Charmed, I'm sure.

703
00:53:16,594 --> 00:53:21,224
Rose: <i>The others were gracious</i>
<i>about the man who saved my life...</i>

704
00:53:21,314 --> 00:53:25,227
<i>..but my mother looked at him</i>
<i>like an insect,...</i>

705
00:53:25,314 --> 00:53:27,509
<i>..a dangerous insect,...</i>

706
00:53:27,594 --> 00:53:29,710
<i>..which must be squashed quickly.</i>

707
00:53:29,794 --> 00:53:34,231
Sounds like you're a good man
to have around in a sticky spot.

708
00:53:34,314 --> 00:53:36,270
(Trumpet playing fanfare)

709
00:53:36,354 --> 00:53:39,869
Why do they always announce dinner
like a damn cavalry charge?

710
00:53:41,154 --> 00:53:43,145
Shall we go dress, Mother?

711
00:53:43,674 --> 00:53:45,665
See you at dinner, Jack.

712
00:53:46,754 --> 00:53:48,346
Uh, son?

713
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:50,345
Son!

714
00:53:50,434 --> 00:53:52,743
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

715
00:53:52,834 --> 00:53:54,631
Not really.

716
00:53:54,714 --> 00:53:58,104
Well, you're about
to go into the snakepit.

717
00:53:58,874 --> 00:54:01,308
What are you planning to wear?

718
00:54:03,354 --> 00:54:05,310
I figured.

719
00:54:05,394 --> 00:54:07,350
Come on.

720
00:54:08,794 --> 00:54:13,265
I was right! You and my son
are just about the same size.

721
00:54:13,354 --> 00:54:15,185
Pretty close.

722
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:18,426
(Whistles)

723
00:54:18,514 --> 00:54:21,108
You shine up like a new penny!

724
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:32,425
Good evening, sir.

725
00:54:39,594 --> 00:54:43,587
(Orchestra playing
"On the Beautiful Blue Danube")

726
00:55:21,914 --> 00:55:23,393
Good evening.

727
00:55:28,954 --> 00:55:31,184
Hello.

728
00:55:33,114 --> 00:55:37,187
Cal: There are several thousand
tons of Hockley steel...

729
00:55:37,274 --> 00:55:40,744
..in this very ship.

730
00:55:40,834 --> 00:55:44,793
Then we'll know who to hold
accountable if there's a problem.

731
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:46,273
There is the Countess.

732
00:55:46,354 --> 00:55:48,310
- Hello, my dear.
- Good evening, Cal.

733
00:55:48,394 --> 00:55:51,113
Cal: So good to see you.

734
00:56:14,114 --> 00:56:18,232
I saw that in a nickelodeon once
and I always wanted to do it.

735
00:56:29,514 --> 00:56:31,470
Ruth: I'll see you at dinner.

736
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:32,623
Darling?

737
00:56:32,714 --> 00:56:35,387
Surely you remember Mr Dawson?

738
00:56:35,834 --> 00:56:37,233
Dawson?

739
00:56:37,314 --> 00:56:41,944
Well, it's amazing!
You could almost pass for a gentleman!

740
00:56:42,994 --> 00:56:44,188
Almost.

741
00:56:44,274 --> 00:56:46,071
Extraordinary!

742
00:56:56,714 --> 00:56:59,706
Ruth: My dear, it's delightful to see you.

743
00:56:59,794 --> 00:57:03,150
What a remarkable voyage this is!
Mad, isn't it?

744
00:57:04,514 --> 00:57:06,789
There's the Countess of Rothes.

745
00:57:08,594 --> 00:57:13,145
And, um... that's John Jacob Astor,
the richest man on the ship.

746
00:57:13,234 --> 00:57:17,910
His little wifey, Madeleine,
is my age and in a delicate condition.

747
00:57:17,994 --> 00:57:20,554
See how she's trying to hide it?

748
00:57:20,634 --> 00:57:22,590
- Quite the scandal.
- Hmm!

749
00:57:22,674 --> 00:57:27,031
And that's Benjamin Guggenheim
and his mistress Madame Aubert.

750
00:57:27,114 --> 00:57:29,628
Mrs Guggenheim is at home
with the children.

751
00:57:29,714 --> 00:57:34,105
And over here we have Sir Cosmo
and Lucille Lady Duff-Gordon.

752
00:57:34,194 --> 00:57:36,389
She designs naughty lingerie.

753
00:57:36,474 --> 00:57:38,465
Very popular with the royals.

754
00:57:38,554 --> 00:57:41,193
Congratulations, Hockley.
She's splendid.

755
00:57:41,274 --> 00:57:43,026
Why, thank you.

756
00:57:43,114 --> 00:57:45,105
Care to escort a lady to dinner?

757
00:57:45,194 --> 00:57:46,707
Certainly.

758
00:57:47,434 --> 00:57:49,345
Sweet pea?

759
00:57:49,434 --> 00:57:50,787
Cal: Sweet pea!

760
00:57:50,874 --> 00:57:54,025
Ain't nothin' to it, Jack.
They love money,...

761
00:57:54,114 --> 00:57:58,392
..so just pretend like you own
a goldmine and you're in the club.

762
00:57:59,514 --> 00:58:01,311
Hey, Astor!

763
00:58:01,754 --> 00:58:04,507
Well, hello, Molly!
Nice to see you.

764
00:58:04,594 --> 00:58:07,347
J.J., Madeleine,
I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.

765
00:58:07,434 --> 00:58:08,787
- How do you do?
- Pleasure.

766
00:58:08,874 --> 00:58:09,863
Hello, Jack.

767
00:58:09,954 --> 00:58:11,865
Are you of the Boston Dawsons?

768
00:58:11,954 --> 00:58:15,344
No... the Chippewa Falls Dawsons,
actually.

769
00:58:15,434 --> 00:58:17,106
Oh, yes...

770
00:58:19,114 --> 00:58:23,551
Rose: <i>He must have been</i>
<i>nervous, but he never faltered.</i>

771
00:58:23,634 --> 00:58:25,750
<i>They assumed he was one of them.</i>

772
00:58:25,834 --> 00:58:28,473
<i>Heir to a railroad fortune, perhaps.</i>

773
00:58:29,434 --> 00:58:33,188
<i>New money, obviously,</i>
<i>but still a member of the club.</i>

774
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:37,109
<i>Mother, of course,</i>
<i>could always be counted upon.</i>

775
00:58:37,194 --> 00:58:40,504
Tell us of the accommodations
in steerage, Mr Dawson.

776
00:58:40,594 --> 00:58:42,391
I hear they're quite good.

777
00:58:42,474 --> 00:58:44,829
The best I've seen, ma'am.

778
00:58:44,914 --> 00:58:46,870
Hardly any rats.

779
00:58:46,954 --> 00:58:48,945
(Laughter)

780
00:58:49,634 --> 00:58:52,751
Mr Dawson is joining us
from the third class.

781
00:58:52,834 --> 00:58:55,792
He was of some assistance
to my fiancée last night.

782
00:58:55,874 --> 00:58:58,024
Mr Dawson is quite a fine artist.

783
00:58:58,114 --> 00:59:01,151
He was kind enough to show me
some of his work today.

784
00:59:01,234 --> 00:59:04,192
Rose and I differ somewhat
in our definition of fine art.

785
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:05,992
Not to impugn your work, sir.

786
00:59:07,634 --> 00:59:09,226
<font color="

787
00:59:10,874 --> 00:59:13,229
Ismay: She may be mine on paper...

788
00:59:13,314 --> 00:59:15,953
..but in the eyes of God
she belongs to Thomas Andrews.

789
00:59:16,034 --> 00:59:17,513
Are these all for me?

790
00:59:17,594 --> 00:59:20,062
Start from the outside
and work your way in.

791
00:59:20,154 --> 00:59:24,113
- He knows every rivet in her.
- Your ship is a wonder, Mr Andrews.

792
00:59:24,194 --> 00:59:25,673
Thank you, Rose.

793
00:59:28,394 --> 00:59:32,023
- How do you take your caviar, sir?
- No caviar for me, thanks.

794
00:59:32,114 --> 00:59:33,593
Never did like it much.

795
00:59:34,714 --> 00:59:37,786
And where exactly do you live,
Mr Dawson?

796
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:40,991
Well, right now my address
is the RMS Titanic.

797
00:59:41,074 --> 00:59:43,269
After that I'm on God's good humour.

798
00:59:43,354 --> 00:59:45,584
And how is it you have means to travel?

799
00:59:45,674 --> 00:59:50,429
I work my way from place to place.
You know, tramp steamers and such.

800
00:59:50,514 --> 00:59:54,348
But I won my ticket on Titanic here
at a lucky hand at poker.

801
00:59:54,434 --> 00:59:56,072
A very lucky hand.

802
00:59:56,794 --> 00:59:58,750
All life is a game of luck.

803
00:59:58,834 --> 01:00:02,713
A real man makes his own luck, Archie.
Right, Dawson?

804
01:00:02,794 --> 01:00:04,113
Mm.

805
01:00:04,194 --> 01:00:08,870
And you find that sort of rootless
existence appealing, do you?

806
01:00:10,514 --> 01:00:12,470
Well, yes, ma'am, I do.

807
01:00:12,554 --> 01:00:16,308
I mean... Got everything I need
right here with me.

808
01:00:16,394 --> 01:00:19,033
Got air in my lungs
and a few sheets of paper.

809
01:00:19,114 --> 01:00:22,709
I love waking up in the morning
not knowing what's gonna happen...

810
01:00:22,794 --> 01:00:26,833
..or who I'm gonna meet,
where I'm gonna wind up.

811
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:29,189
The other night I slept under a bridge.

812
01:00:29,274 --> 01:00:32,072
Now I'm on the grandest ship
in the world...

813
01:00:32,154 --> 01:00:34,907
..having champagne
with you fine people.

814
01:00:34,994 --> 01:00:39,226
I figure life's a gift
and I don't intend on wasting it.

815
01:00:39,314 --> 01:00:43,353
You never know what hand
you're gonna get dealt next.

816
01:00:43,434 --> 01:00:47,063
You learn to take life
as it comes at you,...

817
01:00:47,794 --> 01:00:49,750
..to make each day count.

818
01:00:49,834 --> 01:00:51,472
Well said, Jack.

819
01:00:51,554 --> 01:00:52,782
Hear, hear!

820
01:00:52,874 --> 01:00:55,308
To making it count.

821
01:00:56,754 --> 01:00:58,745
All: To making it count.

822
01:00:58,834 --> 01:00:59,823
Bravo!

823
01:01:03,274 --> 01:01:05,265
(Molly laughing)

824
01:01:06,794 --> 01:01:11,390
Mr Brown had no idea
I'd hidden the money in the stove!

825
01:01:11,474 --> 01:01:15,353
So he comes home drunk as a pig
and he lights a fire!

826
01:01:18,034 --> 01:01:20,753
Next it'll be brandies
in the smoking room.

827
01:01:22,634 --> 01:01:24,750
Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?

828
01:01:24,834 --> 01:01:27,302
Now they retreat
into a cloud of smoke...

829
01:01:27,394 --> 01:01:30,864
..and congratulate each other
on being masters of the universe.

830
01:01:30,954 --> 01:01:32,990
Ladies, thank you for your company.

831
01:01:33,074 --> 01:01:36,749
- May I escort you to the cabin?
- No, I'll stay here.

832
01:01:36,834 --> 01:01:38,506
Here you go, Molly.

833
01:01:39,514 --> 01:01:41,709
Archie: Joining us, Dawson?

834
01:01:41,794 --> 01:01:44,069
Don't want to stay with the women,
do you?

835
01:01:44,154 --> 01:01:46,827
No, thanks.
I've gotta be heading back.

836
01:01:46,914 --> 01:01:51,669
Probably best. It'll be all business
and politics. Wouldn't interest you.

837
01:01:52,754 --> 01:01:55,222
But, Dawson... Good of you to come.

838
01:01:59,874 --> 01:02:01,830
Jack, must you go?

839
01:02:01,914 --> 01:02:04,348
Time for me to row
with the other slaves.

840
01:02:07,514 --> 01:02:09,869
Good night, Rose.

841
01:02:34,914 --> 01:02:36,632
(Clock chiming)

842
01:02:47,674 --> 01:02:50,234
So you wanna go to a real party?

843
01:02:59,194 --> 01:03:01,071
Is okay I put my hand here?

844
01:03:01,154 --> 01:03:02,143
Okay!

845
01:03:15,194 --> 01:03:17,071
Talar fröken svenska?

846
01:03:17,154 --> 01:03:18,223
What?

847
01:03:18,314 --> 01:03:20,111
(Repeats phrase)

848
01:03:20,194 --> 01:03:22,185
I can't understand you.

849
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:33,193
(Glass shatters)

850
01:03:46,914 --> 01:03:48,347
Hey...!

851
01:03:48,434 --> 01:03:50,390
Bravo! Bravo!

852
01:03:50,474 --> 01:03:52,624
Come on, guys, let's go! Ho!

853
01:03:52,714 --> 01:03:55,831
I'm gonna dance with her now,
all right?

854
01:03:55,914 --> 01:03:56,949
Come on.

855
01:03:57,034 --> 01:03:58,467
Come on!

856
01:03:58,554 --> 01:03:59,543
Come with me.

857
01:03:59,634 --> 01:04:01,511
Jack... Jack, wait!

858
01:04:03,114 --> 01:04:04,672
I can't do this.

859
01:04:04,754 --> 01:04:06,745
We have to get a bit closer.

860
01:04:06,834 --> 01:04:08,426
Like this.

861
01:04:10,594 --> 01:04:12,903
You're still my best girl, Cora.

862
01:04:15,434 --> 01:04:19,427
- I don't know the steps.
- Neither do I. Just go with it.

863
01:04:19,514 --> 01:04:21,266
Don't think.

864
01:04:39,194 --> 01:04:41,992
Wait, Jack! Wait! Stop, Jack!

865
01:04:51,514 --> 01:04:52,549
Wait!

866
01:05:30,794 --> 01:05:32,068
Jack: Yeah!

867
01:05:32,154 --> 01:05:33,872
Jack... No!

868
01:05:33,954 --> 01:05:36,263
Whaaa...

869
01:05:39,194 --> 01:05:43,187
..jurisdiction of the Sherman Act,
so my lawyers will argue.

870
01:05:43,274 --> 01:05:46,710
That's what Rockefeller said,
but the court is not swallowing it.

871
01:06:05,914 --> 01:06:07,347
What?

872
01:06:07,434 --> 01:06:10,665
You think a first-class girl can't drink?

873
01:06:10,754 --> 01:06:12,710
Get outta here!

874
01:06:12,794 --> 01:06:14,864
You all right?

875
01:06:18,554 --> 01:06:20,749
Two out of three, two out of three.

876
01:06:20,834 --> 01:06:21,983
So...

877
01:06:23,274 --> 01:06:25,549
You think you're big, tough men?

878
01:06:25,634 --> 01:06:27,670
Let's see you do this.

879
01:06:29,034 --> 01:06:31,229
Hold this for me, Jack.

880
01:06:31,314 --> 01:06:33,111
Hold it up.

881
01:06:46,474 --> 01:06:47,463
Ow!

882
01:06:48,434 --> 01:06:50,390
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

883
01:06:50,474 --> 01:06:53,546
- You all right?
- I haven't done that in years!

884
01:07:01,274 --> 01:07:04,072
Go see Maggie, lads. Let's go!

885
01:07:28,714 --> 01:07:30,705
Coffee, sir?

886
01:07:38,114 --> 01:07:41,311
I had hoped you would
come to me last night.

887
01:07:43,714 --> 01:07:45,864
I was tired.

888
01:07:45,954 --> 01:07:49,913
Your exertions below decks
were no doubt exhausting.

889
01:07:52,114 --> 01:07:57,234
I see you had that undertaker
of a manservant follow me. How typical.

890
01:07:57,314 --> 01:08:01,785
You will never behave like that again,
Rose. Do you understand?

891
01:08:01,914 --> 01:08:06,066
I'm not a foreman in one of your mills
that you can command.

892
01:08:06,154 --> 01:08:08,793
I'm your fiancée.

893
01:08:10,314 --> 01:08:12,270
My fiancée? My fiancée?!

894
01:08:12,354 --> 01:08:15,585
Yes, you are, and my wife!

895
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:20,225
M wife in practice if not yet by law,
so you will honour me.

896
01:08:20,314 --> 01:08:23,545
You will honour me
the way a wife is required to.

897
01:08:23,634 --> 01:08:25,465
I will not be made a fool of.

898
01:08:25,554 --> 01:08:27,784
Is this in any way unclear?

899
01:08:28,834 --> 01:08:30,028
No.

900
01:08:30,114 --> 01:08:31,467
Good.

901
01:08:31,554 --> 01:08:33,510
Excuse me.

902
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:39,945
Miss Rose!

903
01:08:40,034 --> 01:08:43,629
- We had a little... accident.
- That's all right, Miss Rose.

904
01:08:43,714 --> 01:08:46,467
I'm sorry, Trudy. Let me help you.

905
01:08:46,554 --> 01:08:48,545
It's all right, miss.

906
01:08:53,914 --> 01:08:55,905
It's all right, miss.

907
01:09:00,754 --> 01:09:01,823
Tea, Trudy.

908
01:09:01,954 --> 01:09:03,910
Yes, ma'am.

909
01:09:19,354 --> 01:09:23,393
You're not to see that boy again.
Do you understand me?

910
01:09:23,474 --> 01:09:26,068
Rose, I forbid it.

911
01:09:26,154 --> 01:09:29,863
Oh, stop it, Mother.
You'll give yourself a nosebleed.

912
01:09:29,994 --> 01:09:31,825
This is not a game.

913
01:09:31,914 --> 01:09:35,668
Our situation is precarious.
You know the money's gone.

914
01:09:35,754 --> 01:09:38,188
Of course I know it's gone.

915
01:09:38,314 --> 01:09:40,270
You remind me every day.

916
01:09:40,354 --> 01:09:43,983
Your father left us nothing
but a legacy of bad debts...

917
01:09:44,074 --> 01:09:45,587
..hidden by a good name.

918
01:09:45,674 --> 01:09:48,632
That name is the only card
we have to play.

919
01:09:48,714 --> 01:09:50,705
I don't understand you.

920
01:09:51,194 --> 01:09:53,583
It is a fine match with Hockley.

921
01:09:53,674 --> 01:09:55,630
It will ensure our survival.

922
01:09:55,714 --> 01:09:58,182
How can you put this on my shoulders?

923
01:09:58,274 --> 01:09:59,912
Why are you being so selfish?

924
01:09:59,994 --> 01:10:02,383
I'm being selfish?

925
01:10:05,754 --> 01:10:09,190
Do you want to see me
working as a seamstress?

926
01:10:10,274 --> 01:10:12,583
Is that what you want?

927
01:10:14,674 --> 01:10:17,586
To see our fine things
sold at auction?

928
01:10:17,674 --> 01:10:20,586
Our memories scattered to the winds!

929
01:10:31,354 --> 01:10:33,868
It's so unfair.

930
01:10:33,954 --> 01:10:35,945
Of course it's unfair.

931
01:10:37,154 --> 01:10:39,145
We're women.

932
01:10:40,954 --> 01:10:43,343
Our choices are never easy.

933
01:10:49,754 --> 01:10:51,665
Hmm?

934
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:07,627
♫  Protect them by thy guardian hand...  ♫

935
01:11:07,714 --> 01:11:13,027

941
01:11:38,314 --> 01:11:40,066
Hello, Mr Andrews.

942
01:11:40,154 --> 01:11:41,951
Hello, Jack.

943
01:11:49,394 --> 01:11:52,431
- Sir...
- I just need to talk to somebody...

944
01:11:52,514 --> 01:11:54,869
You're not supposed to be in here.

945
01:11:54,954 --> 01:11:56,910
♫  ..fire and foe,...  ♫

946
01:11:56,994 --> 01:11:58,347
♫  ..protect them...  ♫

947
01:11:58,434 --> 01:12:00,948
- You don't remember me?
- No, I don't.

948
01:12:01,034 --> 01:12:03,707
- You'll have to turn around.
- He'll tell you.

949
01:12:03,794 --> 01:12:05,068
I just...

950
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:07,748
Mr Hockley and Mrs DeWitt Bukater...

951
01:12:07,834 --> 01:12:11,543
..continue to be appreciative
of your assistance.

952
01:12:11,634 --> 01:12:14,865
They asked me to give you this
in gratitude.

953
01:12:14,954 --> 01:12:16,546
I don't want your money...

954
01:12:16,634 --> 01:12:22,425
You hold a third-class ticket. Your
presence here is no longer appropriate.

955
01:12:22,514 --> 01:12:24,470
Please, I just wanna speak to Rose...

956
01:12:24,554 --> 01:12:28,183
Gentlemen, please see that Mr Dawson
gets back to where he belongs...

957
01:12:28,314 --> 01:12:30,305
..and that he stays there.

958
01:12:30,394 --> 01:12:31,383
Yes, sir.

959
01:12:31,434 --> 01:12:33,425
Come along, you.

960
01:12:35,034 --> 01:12:38,185
♫  O hear us when we cry to Thee...  ♫

961
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:43,747
♫  ..for those in peril on the sea.  ♫

962
01:12:43,794 --> 01:12:47,628
- Why two steering wheels?
- We only use this near shore.

963
01:12:47,674 --> 01:12:51,349
Sir, another ice warning.
This one's from the Noordam.

964
01:12:51,394 --> 01:12:53,464
Thank you, Sparks.

965
01:12:54,314 --> 01:12:58,023
Oh, not to worry.
Quite normal for this time of year.

966
01:12:58,074 --> 01:13:02,784
In fact, we're speeding up.
I've just ordered the last boilers lit.

967
01:13:06,394 --> 01:13:09,352
Okay, son, wind it up tight
like I showed you.

968
01:13:09,394 --> 01:13:11,385
Okay, let it go.

969
01:13:13,994 --> 01:13:15,871
- Was good, wasn't it?
- Quite nice.

970
01:13:15,914 --> 01:13:17,825
That's excellent, son.

971
01:13:21,354 --> 01:13:24,630
Rose: Mr Andrews, forgive me...

972
01:13:25,674 --> 01:13:27,665
I did the sum in my head...

973
01:13:27,714 --> 01:13:32,105
With the number of lifeboats
times the capacity you mentioned...

974
01:13:32,154 --> 01:13:35,191
..it seems there are not enough
for everyone.

975
01:13:35,234 --> 01:13:37,225
About half, actually.

976
01:13:37,314 --> 01:13:39,828
Rose, you miss nothing, do you?

977
01:13:39,874 --> 01:13:42,672
In fact,
I put in these new type davits...

978
01:13:42,714 --> 01:13:45,467
..which can take an extra row of boats.

979
01:13:45,514 --> 01:13:49,712
But it was thought by some
that the deck would look too cluttered...

980
01:13:49,754 --> 01:13:52,712
..so I was overruled.

981
01:13:52,754 --> 01:13:55,871
Waste of deck space
on an unsinkable ship.

982
01:13:55,914 --> 01:13:57,745
Sleep soundly, young Rose.

983
01:13:57,794 --> 01:14:00,911
I have built you a good ship,
strong and true.

984
01:14:00,954 --> 01:14:03,104
She is all the lifeboat you need.

985
01:14:03,154 --> 01:14:05,145
Just keep heading aft.

986
01:14:05,194 --> 01:14:06,991
Come on.

987
01:14:10,514 --> 01:14:12,869
Jack, this is impossible.

988
01:14:12,914 --> 01:14:14,905
I can't see you.

989
01:14:14,954 --> 01:14:17,946
- I need to talk to you.
- No, Jack, no.

990
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:20,545
Jack, I'm engaged.

991
01:14:22,194 --> 01:14:24,185
I'm marrying Cal.

992
01:14:24,234 --> 01:14:25,986
I love Cal.

993
01:14:28,274 --> 01:14:31,266
Rose... you're no picnic.

994
01:14:32,114 --> 01:14:34,753
You're a spoiled little brat, even.

995
01:14:34,794 --> 01:14:40,073
But you're the most amazingly
astounding, wonderful girl,...

996
01:14:40,114 --> 01:14:41,513
..woman,...

997
01:14:41,554 --> 01:14:44,273
- ..that I've ever known, and...
- Jack...

998
01:14:44,314 --> 01:14:46,305
Let me try and get this out.

999
01:14:46,354 --> 01:14:48,106
You're ama...

1000
01:14:49,314 --> 01:14:52,670
I'm not an idiot.
I know how the world works.

1001
01:14:52,714 --> 01:14:57,310
I've got ten bucks in my pocket
and I have nothing to offer you.

1002
01:14:57,354 --> 01:14:59,345
I understand.

1003
01:14:59,634 --> 01:15:01,625
But I'm too involved now.

1004
01:15:01,674 --> 01:15:03,665
You jump, I jump, remember?

1005
01:15:03,714 --> 01:15:09,027
I can't turn away without knowing
you'll be all right. That's all I want.

1006
01:15:10,794 --> 01:15:12,785
Well, I'm fine.

1007
01:15:13,314 --> 01:15:16,033
I'll be fine... Really.

1008
01:15:16,074 --> 01:15:17,871
Really?

1009
01:15:19,994 --> 01:15:21,985
I don't think so.

1010
01:15:22,034 --> 01:15:26,710
They've got you trapped, Rose,
and you'll die if you don't break free.

1011
01:15:26,754 --> 01:15:29,871
Maybe not right away
because you're strong, but...

1012
01:15:29,914 --> 01:15:33,065
..that fire that I love about you, Rose,...

1013
01:15:33,114 --> 01:15:35,708
..that fire is gonna burn out.

1014
01:15:39,314 --> 01:15:42,192
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.

1015
01:15:44,514 --> 01:15:46,505
You're right.

1016
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:49,302
Only you can do that.

1017
01:15:54,034 --> 01:15:56,025
I'm going back.

1018
01:15:56,074 --> 01:15:58,065
Leave me alone.

1019
01:16:07,674 --> 01:16:11,872
Tell Lucille about the disaster
you had with the stationer's.

1020
01:16:11,914 --> 01:16:14,667
The invitations
had to be sent back twice.

1021
01:16:14,714 --> 01:16:16,113
Oh, my dear!

1022
01:16:16,154 --> 01:16:20,067
And the dreadful bridesmaids' gowns
- what an odyssey that has been!

1023
01:16:20,114 --> 01:16:22,992
Rose decided she wanted lavender.

1024
01:16:23,034 --> 01:16:26,106
She knows I detest the colour,
so she did it to spite me.

1025
01:16:26,154 --> 01:16:28,224
If only you'd come to me sooner.

1026
01:16:28,274 --> 01:16:31,152
Ruth saw some of my designs
in "La Mode Illustrée".

1027
01:16:31,194 --> 01:16:34,345
They were for the Duchess
of Marlborough's youngest.

1028
01:16:34,394 --> 01:16:37,591
They were quite charming.
But I think you'll agree, my dear,...

1029
01:16:37,634 --> 01:16:41,786
..together we've created something
of a phoenix from the ashes!

1030
01:16:53,914 --> 01:16:55,905
Hello, Jack.

1031
01:17:01,154 --> 01:17:03,145
I changed my mind.

1032
01:17:08,074 --> 01:17:11,510
- They said you might be...
- Shh...

1033
01:17:12,154 --> 01:17:14,145
Give me your hand.

1034
01:17:21,274 --> 01:17:24,027
Now close your eyes.

1035
01:17:24,074 --> 01:17:26,065
Go on.

1036
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:30,385
Step up.

1037
01:17:32,874 --> 01:17:35,024
Now hold on to the railing.

1038
01:17:35,074 --> 01:17:37,952
- Keep your eyes closed. Don't peek.
- I'm not.

1039
01:17:39,474 --> 01:17:41,465
Step up onto the rail.

1040
01:17:45,074 --> 01:17:47,065
Hold on... Hold on.

1041
01:17:47,114 --> 01:17:49,264
Keep your eyes closed.

1042
01:17:49,314 --> 01:17:51,305
Do you trust me?

1043
01:17:51,354 --> 01:17:53,265
I trust you.

1044
01:18:02,074 --> 01:18:03,632
All right...

1045
01:18:03,674 --> 01:18:05,665
Open your eyes.

1046
01:18:11,554 --> 01:18:13,146
I'm flying!

1047
01:18:13,194 --> 01:18:14,832
Jack!

1048
01:18:38,194 --> 01:18:42,187
♫  Come, Josephine, on my flying machine,...  ♫

1049
01:18:42,234 --> 01:18:46,944
♫  ..going up, she goes, up, she goes...  ♫

1050
01:19:30,874 --> 01:19:34,833
That was the last time
Titanic ever saw daylight.

1051
01:19:34,874 --> 01:19:38,389
So we're up to dusk
the night of the sinking.

1052
01:19:38,434 --> 01:19:40,425
Six hours to go.

1053
01:19:40,474 --> 01:19:45,423
Smith's standing there, the iceberg
warning in his fucking hand,...

1054
01:19:45,474 --> 01:19:48,068
..and he's ordering more speed.

1055
01:19:48,114 --> 01:19:51,550
26 years of experience
working against him.

1056
01:19:51,594 --> 01:19:56,270
He figures anything big enough
to sink the ship they'll see in time to turn.

1057
01:19:56,314 --> 01:20:01,229
But the ship's too big with too small
a rudder. Doesn't corner worth a damn.

1058
01:20:01,274 --> 01:20:03,390
Everything he knows is wrong.

1059
01:20:14,674 --> 01:20:17,666
It's quite proper, I assure you!

1060
01:20:17,714 --> 01:20:19,705
This is the sitting room.

1061
01:20:20,714 --> 01:20:22,989
- Will this light do?
- What?

1062
01:20:23,034 --> 01:20:25,150
Don't artists need good light?

1063
01:20:25,234 --> 01:20:28,271
<font color="
used to working in such...

1064
01:20:28,314 --> 01:20:29,872
..horrible conditions.

1065
01:20:30,554 --> 01:20:32,351
Monet!

1066
01:20:32,714 --> 01:20:35,592
- Do you know his work?
- Of course!

1067
01:20:35,674 --> 01:20:37,790
Look at his use of colour here!

1068
01:20:37,834 --> 01:20:39,745
I know, it's extraordinary.

1069
01:20:41,594 --> 01:20:45,507
Cal insists on carting
this hideous thing everywhere.

1070
01:20:45,994 --> 01:20:48,872
Should we be expecting him
any time soon?

1071
01:20:49,194 --> 01:20:52,345
Not as long as the cigars
and brandy hold out.

1072
01:20:54,474 --> 01:20:56,465
That's nice!

1073
01:20:56,514 --> 01:20:58,869
What is it? A sapphire?

1074
01:20:58,914 --> 01:21:00,791
A diamond.

1075
01:21:00,834 --> 01:21:02,552
A very rare diamond.

1076
01:21:04,554 --> 01:21:08,388
Jack, I want you to draw me
like one of your French girls...

1077
01:21:09,394 --> 01:21:11,350
..wearing this.

1078
01:21:11,394 --> 01:21:12,543
All right.

1079
01:21:14,154 --> 01:21:16,145
Wearing only this.

1080
01:21:50,114 --> 01:21:51,866
The last thing I need...

1081
01:21:51,954 --> 01:21:56,106
..is another picture of me
looking like a porcelain doll.

1082
01:21:57,394 --> 01:21:59,430
As a paying customer...

1083
01:22:01,314 --> 01:22:03,748
..I expect to get what I want.

1084
01:22:20,394 --> 01:22:22,954
Over on the bed... the couch.

1085
01:22:30,914 --> 01:22:32,632
Go... lie down.

1086
01:22:35,394 --> 01:22:37,350
Tell me when it looks right.

1087
01:22:37,394 --> 01:22:39,988
Put your arm back the way it was.

1088
01:22:40,034 --> 01:22:41,467
Right.

1089
01:22:41,514 --> 01:22:45,223
Put that other arm up...
That hand right by your face.

1090
01:22:45,274 --> 01:22:47,265
Right.

1091
01:22:48,594 --> 01:22:50,824
Now, head down...

1092
01:22:52,994 --> 01:22:54,985
Eyes to me. Keep them on me.

1093
01:22:55,794 --> 01:22:57,785
And try to stay still.

1094
01:23:16,314 --> 01:23:17,713
So serious!

1095
01:23:57,674 --> 01:24:01,986
I believe you are blushing,
Mr Big Artiste.

1096
01:24:05,114 --> 01:24:08,629
I can't imagine
Monsieur Monet blushing.

1097
01:24:08,674 --> 01:24:11,029
He does landscapes.

1098
01:24:11,074 --> 01:24:14,146
- Just relax your face.
- Sorry.

1099
01:24:14,194 --> 01:24:16,185
No laughing.

1100
01:24:45,114 --> 01:24:48,106
My heart was pounding
the whole time.

1101
01:24:48,394 --> 01:24:52,182
It was the most erotic moment
of my life.

1102
01:24:55,794 --> 01:24:58,228
Up until then, at least.

1103
01:24:58,274 --> 01:25:00,026
So what happened next?

1104
01:25:00,074 --> 01:25:03,703
You mean... did we do it?

1105
01:25:05,754 --> 01:25:08,109
Sorry to disappoint you, Mr Bodine.

1106
01:25:08,154 --> 01:25:10,509
Jack was very professional.

1107
01:25:18,794 --> 01:25:20,591
Thank you.

1108
01:25:27,794 --> 01:25:29,785
What are you doing?

1109
01:25:29,834 --> 01:25:33,304
Will you put this back
in the safe for me?

1110
01:25:43,514 --> 01:25:45,505
Would you excuse me?

1111
01:25:46,514 --> 01:25:49,426
None of the stewards have seen her.

1112
01:25:49,474 --> 01:25:51,465
This is absurd.

1113
01:25:51,514 --> 01:25:55,223
It's a ship. There's only
so many places she could be.

1114
01:25:55,274 --> 01:25:57,151
Lovejoy, find her.

1115
01:26:13,874 --> 01:26:15,865
- Clear.
- Yes.

1116
01:26:16,514 --> 01:26:19,665
I don't think I've ever seen
such a flat calm.

1117
01:26:19,714 --> 01:26:21,386
Like a millpond.

1118
01:26:21,434 --> 01:26:23,425
Not a breath of wind.

1119
01:26:25,074 --> 01:26:27,793
It will make the bergs harder to see...

1120
01:26:28,114 --> 01:26:30,753
..with no breaking water at the base.

1121
01:26:40,674 --> 01:26:42,505
Well, I'm off.

1122
01:26:42,554 --> 01:26:45,751
Maintain speed and heading,
Mr Lightoller.

1123
01:26:45,794 --> 01:26:47,227
Yes, sir.

1124
01:26:57,434 --> 01:26:59,425
It's getting cold.

1125
01:26:59,474 --> 01:27:01,032
You look nice.

1126
01:27:01,074 --> 01:27:02,632
Lovejoy: Miss Rose?

1127
01:27:02,674 --> 01:27:04,073
My drawings!

1128
01:27:10,194 --> 01:27:12,389
(Door closes)

1129
01:27:33,194 --> 01:27:34,593
Wait!

1130
01:27:34,634 --> 01:27:36,352
Wait, wait, wait!

1131
01:27:36,394 --> 01:27:37,429
Go, go!

1132
01:27:37,474 --> 01:27:38,668
Down, down!

1133
01:27:45,474 --> 01:27:46,463
Bye!

1134
01:27:53,594 --> 01:27:54,583
Sorry!

1135
01:28:11,274 --> 01:28:13,993
Pretty tough for a valet, this fellow.

1136
01:28:14,034 --> 01:28:16,787
- Seems more like a cop.
- I think he was.

1137
01:28:16,834 --> 01:28:19,109
Jack: Oh, shit!

1138
01:28:23,634 --> 01:28:25,625
No, over here!

1139
01:28:25,674 --> 01:28:27,232
Quick!

1140
01:28:29,794 --> 01:28:31,785
(Boiler blasting)

1141
01:28:33,114 --> 01:28:34,706
Now what!

1142
01:28:34,754 --> 01:28:36,073
What!

1143
01:28:42,714 --> 01:28:45,274
What are you two doing here?

1144
01:28:45,314 --> 01:28:47,828
You shouldn't be here!
It's dangerous!

1145
01:28:51,514 --> 01:28:53,106
Jack: Carry on!

1146
01:28:53,154 --> 01:28:57,147
Don't mind us! You're doing a great job!
Keep up the good work!

1147
01:29:12,674 --> 01:29:15,063
Look what we have here, huh?

1148
01:29:24,354 --> 01:29:26,345
(Rose clears throat)

1149
01:29:32,074 --> 01:29:33,871
Thank you.

1150
01:29:42,674 --> 01:29:44,392
(Honks horn)

1151
01:29:44,434 --> 01:29:46,425
Where to, miss?

1152
01:29:47,554 --> 01:29:49,545
To the stars.

1153
01:30:07,234 --> 01:30:09,225
Are you nervous?

1154
01:30:11,434 --> 01:30:13,425
No.

1155
01:30:28,514 --> 01:30:30,903
Put your hands on me, Jack.

1156
01:30:52,394 --> 01:30:54,783
Crewman: God, it's bloody cold.

1157
01:30:54,834 --> 01:30:58,588
You know, I can smell ice,
you know... when it's near.

1158
01:31:00,114 --> 01:31:01,433
Bollocks.

1159
01:31:01,474 --> 01:31:03,305
But I can, all right?

1160
01:31:03,354 --> 01:31:05,868
Did you ever find those binoculars?

1161
01:31:05,914 --> 01:31:08,474
Haven't seen them since Southampton.

1162
01:31:08,514 --> 01:31:11,074
Well, I'll be on my rounds. Cheerio.

1163
01:31:41,394 --> 01:31:43,385
You're trembling.

1164
01:31:44,674 --> 01:31:47,234
Don't worry. I'll be all right.

1165
01:32:07,274 --> 01:32:09,185
They ran down there.

1166
01:32:09,234 --> 01:32:10,633
Right.

1167
01:32:19,554 --> 01:32:21,545
Anything missing?

1168
01:32:45,034 --> 01:32:47,025
I've got a better idea.

1169
01:32:58,594 --> 01:33:00,073
Gotcha!

1170
01:33:02,074 --> 01:33:04,065
(Rose laughing)

1171
01:33:10,034 --> 01:33:12,150
Did you see those guys' faces?

1172
01:33:12,554 --> 01:33:14,545
Did you see the...?

1173
01:33:20,274 --> 01:33:22,708
When the ship docks...

1174
01:33:22,754 --> 01:33:24,745
..I'm getting off with you.

1175
01:33:24,794 --> 01:33:26,989
This is crazy.

1176
01:33:27,034 --> 01:33:29,423
I know! It doesn't make any sense.

1177
01:33:30,834 --> 01:33:32,825
That's why I trust it.

1178
01:33:41,074 --> 01:33:44,146
Oh, yes... Here, look at this.

1179
01:33:44,194 --> 01:33:48,506
- Look at that, would ya?
- They're a bit warmer than we are.

1180
01:33:48,554 --> 01:33:53,867
Well, if that's what it takes for us
to get warm, I'd rather not!

1181
01:34:04,274 --> 01:34:06,230
Bugger me!

1182
01:34:06,274 --> 01:34:07,992
(Alarm bell clanging)

1183
01:34:09,794 --> 01:34:10,863
(Phone)

1184
01:34:10,914 --> 01:34:12,825
Pick up, you bastards!

1185
01:34:12,874 --> 01:34:15,434
(Phone ringing)

1186
01:34:15,474 --> 01:34:18,625
- Is there anyone there?!
- Yes, what do you see?

1187
01:34:18,674 --> 01:34:20,232
Iceberg! Right ahead!

1188
01:34:20,314 --> 01:34:22,032
Thank you.

1189
01:34:22,794 --> 01:34:24,625
Iceberg! Right ahead!

1190
01:34:24,674 --> 01:34:26,869
Hard to starboard!

1191
01:34:31,714 --> 01:34:33,067
(Ringing)

1192
01:34:33,114 --> 01:34:35,582
Crewman: Turn! Turn! Steady!

1193
01:34:37,474 --> 01:34:39,271
(Bell clangs)

1194
01:34:40,034 --> 01:34:41,592
Full astern!

1195
01:34:43,274 --> 01:34:44,673
Hard over!

1196
01:34:44,714 --> 01:34:46,705
Helm's hard over, sir!

1197
01:34:48,314 --> 01:34:49,986
<font color="

1198
01:34:50,034 --> 01:34:51,752
Go, lads! Go!

1199
01:34:57,794 --> 01:34:59,944
Shut all the dampers!

1200
01:34:59,994 --> 01:35:01,712
Shut them!

1201
01:35:01,754 --> 01:35:03,631
(Dampers slamming)

1202
01:35:05,514 --> 01:35:06,947
Hold it!

1203
01:35:08,034 --> 01:35:09,183
Hold it!

1204
01:35:10,554 --> 01:35:13,387
Now! Engage the reversing engine!

1205
01:35:14,754 --> 01:35:16,824
(Engine stops)

1206
01:35:21,914 --> 01:35:23,905
(Engine restarts)

1207
01:35:39,314 --> 01:35:41,589
Why aren't they turning?!

1208
01:35:41,634 --> 01:35:43,147
Is it hard over?!

1209
01:35:43,194 --> 01:35:45,503
It is, yes, sir, hard over!

1210
01:35:48,474 --> 01:35:52,149
Come on... come on... come on...

1211
01:35:52,194 --> 01:35:53,627
Turn...

1212
01:36:03,474 --> 01:36:05,146
Yes...

1213
01:36:09,674 --> 01:36:11,665
It's going to hit!

1214
01:36:22,394 --> 01:36:23,952
Jesus Christ!

1215
01:36:37,074 --> 01:36:39,713
(Glass tinkling)

1216
01:36:43,234 --> 01:36:44,986
Jesus...

1217
01:36:45,034 --> 01:36:46,183
Hard to port!

1218
01:36:46,234 --> 01:36:47,713
Crewman: Hard to port!

1219
01:36:51,234 --> 01:36:53,190
(Men screaming)

1220
01:36:57,074 --> 01:36:58,871
Get back!

1221
01:37:26,714 --> 01:37:30,024
Come on, let's go!
They're closing the doors!

1222
01:37:30,074 --> 01:37:31,632
Get out!

1223
01:37:32,674 --> 01:37:34,665
Get out! Get out!

1224
01:37:37,634 --> 01:37:38,987
Get out the door!

1225
01:37:39,034 --> 01:37:40,149
Go on!

1226
01:37:40,194 --> 01:37:41,946
Come on, lads!

1227
01:37:41,994 --> 01:37:43,222
Go, lads, go!

1228
01:37:50,234 --> 01:37:51,110
Get out!

1229
01:38:10,234 --> 01:38:11,553
Oh, my God...

1230
01:38:11,594 --> 01:38:14,188
That was a close shave, weren't it?

1231
01:38:14,234 --> 01:38:17,431
Smell ice, can ya? Bleedin' Christ!

1232
01:38:20,914 --> 01:38:23,986
Note the time and enter it in the log.

1233
01:38:29,034 --> 01:38:31,184
What was that, Mr Murdoch?

1234
01:38:31,234 --> 01:38:33,350
An iceberg, sir.

1235
01:38:33,394 --> 01:38:37,023
I put her hard to starboard
and ran the engines full astern...

1236
01:38:37,074 --> 01:38:40,510
..but it was too close.
I tried to port round it, but she hit and...

1237
01:38:40,554 --> 01:38:44,149
- Close the watertight doors.
- Doors are closed, sir.

1238
01:38:46,474 --> 01:38:48,749
All stop.

1239
01:38:50,834 --> 01:38:52,825
(Ringing)

1240
01:38:54,914 --> 01:38:57,712
Find the carpenter.
Get him to sound the ship.

1241
01:38:57,754 --> 01:38:58,743
Yes, sir!

1242
01:39:02,274 --> 01:39:04,947
Fabrizio: Porca puttana!

1243
01:39:04,994 --> 01:39:06,985
Che cazzo e?

1244
01:39:08,714 --> 01:39:11,433
Come on,
let's get the hell out of here!

1245
01:39:11,474 --> 01:39:13,192
Come on, hurry up!

1246
01:39:17,714 --> 01:39:20,865
Why have the engines stopped?
I felt a shudder.

1247
01:39:20,914 --> 01:39:25,271
I shouldn't worry, madam.
We've likely thrown a propeller blade.

1248
01:39:25,314 --> 01:39:28,112
- May I bring you anything?
- No, thank you.

1249
01:39:32,754 --> 01:39:37,145
- Did you see anything?
- I don't see anything now, do you?

1250
01:39:38,114 --> 01:39:42,312
If this is the direction the rats are going,
that's good enough for me.

1251
01:39:43,954 --> 01:39:47,390
Please, sir, please...
everything's under control.

1252
01:39:48,594 --> 01:39:51,154
- You there.
- Sir, there is no emergency.

1253
01:39:51,194 --> 01:39:53,549
- I have been robbed.
- Get the master-at-arms.

1254
01:39:53,594 --> 01:39:56,233
- Now, you moron!
- Yes, sir.

1255
01:39:56,274 --> 01:39:58,424
(Men laughing)

1256
01:40:00,154 --> 01:40:02,349
Hey, you're gonna miss the fun.

1257
01:40:02,394 --> 01:40:06,706
- Did you see what happened?
- No. Apparently, it hit over there.

1258
01:40:08,194 --> 01:40:11,072
It's flooded eight feet
and the mail hold is worse.

1259
01:40:11,114 --> 01:40:14,186
- Can you shore up?
- Not unless the pumps get ahead.

1260
01:40:14,234 --> 01:40:17,909
- Have you seen the mail-hold damage?
- No, she's already underwater.

1261
01:40:17,954 --> 01:40:19,945
This is bad.

1262
01:40:20,114 --> 01:40:22,184
We should tell Mother and Cal.

1263
01:40:24,354 --> 01:40:26,549
I think they're very good, sir.

1264
01:40:27,514 --> 01:40:31,712
Don't touch anything.
I want the entire room photographed.

1265
01:40:31,754 --> 01:40:34,029
Rose: Just keep holding my hand.

1266
01:40:36,154 --> 01:40:38,543
We've been looking for you, miss.

1267
01:40:42,114 --> 01:40:44,309
Rose: Well, here we go.

1268
01:40:48,954 --> 01:40:51,309
Something serious has happened.

1269
01:40:52,714 --> 01:40:54,591
Yes, it has.

1270
01:40:54,634 --> 01:40:59,025
Indeed. Two things dear to me
have disappeared this evening.

1271
01:40:59,074 --> 01:41:03,829
Now that one is back, I've an idea
where to find the other. Search him.

1272
01:41:03,874 --> 01:41:06,627
- Take your coat off, sir.
- Now what?

1273
01:41:06,674 --> 01:41:08,949
Cal, we're in the middle
of an emergency.

1274
01:41:08,994 --> 01:41:10,666
What's going on?

1275
01:41:10,714 --> 01:41:12,466
- Is this it?
- That's it.

1276
01:41:12,514 --> 01:41:14,744
This is horseshit!

1277
01:41:14,794 --> 01:41:16,864
Don't you believe it, Rose!

1278
01:41:16,914 --> 01:41:21,226
- He couldn't have.
- Of course he could.

1279
01:41:21,274 --> 01:41:23,629
But I was with him the whole time.

1280
01:41:23,674 --> 01:41:28,190
Perhaps he did it while you were
putting your clothes back on, dear.

1281
01:41:28,234 --> 01:41:30,384
Rose, they put it in my pocket.

1282
01:41:30,434 --> 01:41:31,469
Shut up.

1283
01:41:31,514 --> 01:41:33,391
It isn't even your pocket.

1284
01:41:33,434 --> 01:41:35,026
Property of A. L. Ryerson.

1285
01:41:39,074 --> 01:41:43,192
- That was reported stolen.
- I borrowed it. I was gonna return it.

1286
01:41:43,234 --> 01:41:47,227
- We have an honest thief, do we?
- You know I didn't do this, Rose.

1287
01:41:47,274 --> 01:41:50,107
Don't you believe them, Rose.

1288
01:41:50,154 --> 01:41:53,226
You know I didn't do it.
You know I didn't do it, Rose!

1289
01:41:53,274 --> 01:41:55,663
Come on, son. There's a good lad.

1290
01:41:55,714 --> 01:41:56,703
Come on.

1291
01:41:56,754 --> 01:41:59,029
You know I didn't do it!
You know me!

1292
01:42:00,674 --> 01:42:03,666
Ismay: Most unfortunate, Captain.

1293
01:42:05,954 --> 01:42:09,344
Water... 14 feet above the keel
in 10 minutes...

1294
01:42:09,754 --> 01:42:13,144
..in the forepeak, in all three holds
and in boiler room six.

1295
01:42:13,194 --> 01:42:14,547
That's right, sir.

1296
01:42:14,594 --> 01:42:19,110
- When can we get under way, damn it!
- That's five compartments!

1297
01:42:19,234 --> 01:42:24,308
She can stay afloat with the first four
compartments breached, but not five.

1298
01:42:24,354 --> 01:42:25,787
Not five.

1299
01:42:25,834 --> 01:42:27,870
As she goes down by the head...

1300
01:42:27,914 --> 01:42:32,066
..the water will spill over
the bulkheads, from one to the next.

1301
01:42:32,114 --> 01:42:34,867
Back and back.
There's no stopping it.

1302
01:42:34,914 --> 01:42:35,869
The pumps...

1303
01:42:35,914 --> 01:42:39,668
The pumps buy you time,
but minutes only.

1304
01:42:39,714 --> 01:42:42,467
From this moment,
no matter what we do,...

1305
01:42:42,514 --> 01:42:45,108
..Titanic will founder.

1306
01:42:47,354 --> 01:42:49,345
But this ship can't sink.

1307
01:42:49,394 --> 01:42:52,306
She's made of iron, sir.
I assure you she can,...

1308
01:42:52,354 --> 01:42:54,663
..and she will.

1309
01:42:54,714 --> 01:42:57,182
It is a mathematical certainty.

1310
01:43:00,474 --> 01:43:02,465
How much time?

1311
01:43:08,274 --> 01:43:09,787
An hour...

1312
01:43:09,834 --> 01:43:11,950
Two at most.

1313
01:43:16,514 --> 01:43:19,267
And how many aboard, Mr Murdoch?

1314
01:43:19,314 --> 01:43:21,782
2,200 souls on board, sir.

1315
01:43:27,554 --> 01:43:31,547
Well, I believe you may get
your headlines, Mr Ismay.

1316
01:43:48,432 --> 01:43:52,630
Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it?
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

1317
01:43:52,672 --> 01:43:53,946
(Knock at door)

1318
01:43:53,992 --> 01:43:56,187
- Mr Hockley?
- Not now! We're busy!

1319
01:43:56,232 --> 01:43:58,746
Sir, please put on your lifebelt...

1320
01:43:58,792 --> 01:44:01,625
I said not now.

1321
01:44:01,672 --> 01:44:05,790
I'm sorry but it's Captain's orders.
Now, please, dress warmly.

1322
01:44:05,832 --> 01:44:08,062
It's quite cold out tonight.

1323
01:44:08,112 --> 01:44:10,467
May I suggest topcoats and hats?

1324
01:44:10,512 --> 01:44:12,503
This is ridiculous.

1325
01:44:13,272 --> 01:44:17,345
Not to worry, miss.
I am sure it's just a precaution.

1326
01:44:17,392 --> 01:44:19,542
Everybody up! Lifebelts on!

1327
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:22,505
What's he on about?

1328
01:44:22,552 --> 01:44:24,907
- Lifebelts on!
- What's the ruckus?

1329
01:44:24,952 --> 01:44:26,670
Just put your lifebelts on!

1330
01:44:26,752 --> 01:44:29,061
Crewman: CQD?

1331
01:44:29,112 --> 01:44:30,909
Sir?

1332
01:44:31,192 --> 01:44:34,423
That's right. CQD. The distress call.

1333
01:44:34,512 --> 01:44:36,150
That's our position.

1334
01:44:39,992 --> 01:44:43,871
Tell whoever responds
that we're going down by the head...

1335
01:44:43,912 --> 01:44:46,790
..and need immediate assistance.

1336
01:44:54,592 --> 01:44:56,389
Blimey!

1337
01:45:05,992 --> 01:45:08,506
Keep lowering! Keep lowering!

1338
01:45:27,992 --> 01:45:29,471
Mr Wilde!

1339
01:45:29,512 --> 01:45:31,468
Where are the passengers?

1340
01:45:31,512 --> 01:45:36,142
We moved them back inside.
It's too damn cold and noisy for them.

1341
01:45:36,192 --> 01:45:37,420
(Blows whistle)

1342
01:45:37,472 --> 01:45:39,383
Help with these lines!

1343
01:45:39,432 --> 01:45:43,027
(Orchestra playing
"Alexander's Ragtime Band")

1344
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:55,143
Care for a drink, sir?

1345
01:45:56,552 --> 01:46:00,340
Hey, sonny, what's doing?
You got us all trussed up here...

1346
01:46:00,392 --> 01:46:04,704
- ..and now we're cooling our heels.
- Sorry, ma'am. Let me find out.

1347
01:46:04,752 --> 01:46:07,744
I don't think anybody knows
what the hell's going on.

1348
01:46:07,792 --> 01:46:11,148
It's the goddamned English
doing everything by the... book.

1349
01:46:11,192 --> 01:46:13,422
There's no need for language, Mr Hockley.

1350
01:46:13,472 --> 01:46:17,943
Go and turn the heaters on in our rooms.
I'd like a cup of tea when I return.

1351
01:46:17,992 --> 01:46:19,664
Yes, ma'am.

1352
01:46:21,352 --> 01:46:24,264
Man: This ship
has 15 watertight barricades.

1353
01:46:24,312 --> 01:46:27,782
Crewman: Would you
put your lifebelt on, please?

1354
01:46:28,192 --> 01:46:29,261
Mr Andrews...

1355
01:46:31,432 --> 01:46:35,027
I saw the iceberg,
and I see it in your eyes.

1356
01:46:35,072 --> 01:46:37,540
Please tell me the truth.

1357
01:46:44,112 --> 01:46:46,103
The ship will sink.

1358
01:46:46,552 --> 01:46:48,508
You're certain?

1359
01:46:48,552 --> 01:46:50,747
Yes. In an hour or so...

1360
01:46:51,192 --> 01:46:54,980
..all this will be
at the bottom of the Atlantic.

1361
01:46:55,032 --> 01:46:56,624
What?

1362
01:46:56,672 --> 01:47:01,268
Tell only who you must. I don't want
to be responsible for a panic.

1363
01:47:01,312 --> 01:47:03,951
And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait.

1364
01:47:03,992 --> 01:47:07,029
You remember what I told you
about the boats?

1365
01:47:09,992 --> 01:47:11,710
Yes...

1366
01:47:12,792 --> 01:47:14,544
I understand.

1367
01:47:22,192 --> 01:47:23,944
Over here, sir.

1368
01:47:23,992 --> 01:47:28,383
Sir, they need you in the second-class
purser's office. There's a mob up there.

1369
01:47:28,432 --> 01:47:32,391
- Go on. I'll keep an eye on him.
- Aye. Right.

1370
01:47:44,592 --> 01:47:48,949
Sir! Carpathia says
they're making 17 knots.

1371
01:47:48,992 --> 01:47:51,711
Full steam for them, sir.

1372
01:47:51,752 --> 01:47:54,903
- She's the only one responding?
- The only one close, sir.

1373
01:47:54,952 --> 01:47:56,829
They can be here in four hours.

1374
01:47:56,872 --> 01:47:58,908
Four hours?!

1375
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:05,703
Thank you, Bride.

1376
01:48:09,152 --> 01:48:11,143
My God...!

1377
01:48:11,192 --> 01:48:13,183
(Crewmen yelling out orders)

1378
01:48:18,312 --> 01:48:19,825
Sir!

1379
01:48:19,872 --> 01:48:22,261
We are swung out and ready, sir.

1380
01:48:22,312 --> 01:48:26,908
Hadn't we better get the women
and children into the boats, sir?

1381
01:48:28,712 --> 01:48:30,430
Yes, we...

1382
01:48:30,472 --> 01:48:31,700
Sir?

1383
01:48:34,192 --> 01:48:36,387
Women and children first.

1384
01:48:36,432 --> 01:48:38,184
Yes.

1385
01:48:38,232 --> 01:48:40,223
Yes, sir.

1386
01:48:41,832 --> 01:48:45,302
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please!

1387
01:48:45,352 --> 01:48:48,105
Step this way, please! That's right.

1388
01:48:48,152 --> 01:48:50,188
Come towards me!

1389
01:48:50,232 --> 01:48:52,063
Thank you.

1390
01:48:52,112 --> 01:48:53,067
Good.

1391
01:48:53,152 --> 01:48:57,430
For the time being I shall require
only women and children.

1392
01:48:57,472 --> 01:48:59,463
Right here.

1393
01:48:59,512 --> 01:49:01,662
Like the Captain said,...

1394
01:49:01,712 --> 01:49:04,385
..nice and cheery
so there's no panic.

1395
01:49:04,432 --> 01:49:06,388
"Wedding Dance."

1396
01:49:13,472 --> 01:49:16,350
Lifebelts on!
Put your lifebelts on!

1397
01:49:16,392 --> 01:49:17,905
Put your lifebelts on!

1398
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:21,342
Here, put your lifebelt on.
Here, come on...

1399
01:49:26,912 --> 01:49:29,665
It isn't time to go up
to the boats yet.

1400
01:49:29,712 --> 01:49:31,668
Please stay calm.

1401
01:49:31,712 --> 01:49:35,387
Look, please make sure
you've got your lifebelts on.

1402
01:49:35,432 --> 01:49:37,662
Women and children to the front.

1403
01:49:37,712 --> 01:49:39,703
What are we doing, Mummy?

1404
01:49:39,752 --> 01:49:44,542
When the first-class people
are in the boats, they'll start with us...

1405
01:49:44,592 --> 01:49:46,423
..and we'll want to be ready.

1406
01:49:46,472 --> 01:49:48,588
(Men arguing)

1407
01:49:48,632 --> 01:49:50,668
Go and get some help.

1408
01:49:50,712 --> 01:49:53,351
Lower away! Left and right together!

1409
01:49:53,392 --> 01:49:54,791
Steady!

1410
01:49:54,832 --> 01:49:56,948
Both sides together!

1411
01:49:56,992 --> 01:49:58,345
Steady!

1412
01:49:58,392 --> 01:49:59,791
Steady!

1413
01:49:59,832 --> 01:50:01,902
Steady!

1414
01:50:01,952 --> 01:50:04,022
Stop! Stop!

1415
01:50:04,072 --> 01:50:05,346
(Screaming)

1416
01:50:05,392 --> 01:50:06,666
Hold the left side!

1417
01:50:06,712 --> 01:50:09,431
Right side only! Right side only!

1418
01:50:09,472 --> 01:50:10,871
Right side only!

1419
01:50:10,912 --> 01:50:12,311
Hold the left side!

1420
01:50:12,352 --> 01:50:14,866
Right side down!
Lower away together!

1421
01:50:16,512 --> 01:50:18,503
Steady, lads!

1422
01:51:04,112 --> 01:51:07,821
You know, I do believe this ship may sink.

1423
01:51:07,912 --> 01:51:13,066
I've been asked to give you this
small token of our appreciation.

1424
01:51:16,152 --> 01:51:18,746
Compliments of Mr Caledon Hockley.

1425
01:51:24,712 --> 01:51:27,909
Come on, sister, you heard the man.
Into the boat.

1426
01:51:27,952 --> 01:51:33,185
- Any room for a gentleman, gentlemen?
- Only women at this time, sir.

1427
01:51:33,232 --> 01:51:37,225
Will the lifeboats be seated
according to class?

1428
01:51:38,672 --> 01:51:41,505
I hope they're not too crowded.

1429
01:51:41,552 --> 01:51:45,340
Oh, Mother... Shut up!
Don't you understand?!

1430
01:51:45,392 --> 01:51:49,829
The water is freezing and there aren't
enough boats! Not enough by half.

1431
01:51:49,872 --> 01:51:53,262
Half the people on this ship
are going to die.

1432
01:51:53,312 --> 01:51:55,348
Not the better half.

1433
01:51:55,392 --> 01:51:57,826
Come on, Ruth, get in the boat.

1434
01:51:57,872 --> 01:52:00,545
First-class seats are right up here.

1435
01:52:00,592 --> 01:52:04,665
It's a pity I didn't keep that drawing.
It'll be worth more by morning.

1436
01:52:04,712 --> 01:52:08,546
Crewman: Women and children
towards the front.

1437
01:52:08,592 --> 01:52:10,742
You unimaginable bastard.

1438
01:52:11,632 --> 01:52:15,910
Molly: Come on, Rose, darling.
There's plenty of room for you.

1439
01:52:15,952 --> 01:52:19,991
- Come on, Rose. You're next.
- Come into the boat, Rose.

1440
01:52:20,832 --> 01:52:22,345
Cal: Come.

1441
01:52:22,392 --> 01:52:24,189
Rose!

1442
01:52:24,992 --> 01:52:26,983
Get into the boat!

1443
01:52:27,032 --> 01:52:29,023
Rose...

1444
01:52:29,432 --> 01:52:31,343
Goodbye, Mother.

1445
01:52:33,032 --> 01:52:34,624
Rose?

1446
01:52:34,672 --> 01:52:37,186
Where are you going?

1447
01:52:37,232 --> 01:52:39,109
To him?!

1448
01:52:39,152 --> 01:52:41,461
To be a whore to a gutter rat?!

1449
01:52:41,512 --> 01:52:44,185
I'd rather be his whore
than your wife!

1450
01:52:46,352 --> 01:52:47,865
No... No!

1451
01:52:48,992 --> 01:52:51,187
I said no!

1452
01:52:51,232 --> 01:52:52,950
Ruth: Rose!

1453
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:54,903
Please stop!

1454
01:52:54,952 --> 01:52:57,910
- And lower away!
- Rose!

1455
01:52:57,952 --> 01:53:00,261
- Man the tiller!
- No, wait!

1456
01:53:00,312 --> 01:53:02,587
Rose!

1457
01:53:02,632 --> 01:53:04,748
Hold the left side there!

1458
01:53:07,552 --> 01:53:08,667
Help!

1459
01:53:08,712 --> 01:53:11,784
Can anybody hear me!

1460
01:53:11,832 --> 01:53:14,744
Hello, help me!

1461
01:53:14,792 --> 01:53:16,783
Help me!

1462
01:53:17,952 --> 01:53:20,420
Help me! Can anybody hear me!

1463
01:53:20,472 --> 01:53:23,066
Somebody help me!

1464
01:53:24,392 --> 01:53:26,383
Mr Andrews!

1465
01:53:28,912 --> 01:53:31,107
Check the starboard corridor.

1466
01:53:31,152 --> 01:53:34,224
Madam, please, put on a lifebelt.

1467
01:53:34,272 --> 01:53:38,345
Lucy, for God's sake, put on
your lifebelt. Set a good example.

1468
01:53:38,392 --> 01:53:39,461
Anyone in here?

1469
01:53:39,512 --> 01:53:44,108
Mr Andrews, thank God! Where would
they take someone under arrest?

1470
01:53:44,152 --> 01:53:46,825
You have to get to a boat right away.

1471
01:53:46,872 --> 01:53:51,184
I'm doing this with or without your help,
but without will take longer.

1472
01:53:51,992 --> 01:53:57,350
Take the elevator to the very bottom.
Go left down the crewmen's passage.

1473
01:53:57,392 --> 01:54:01,510
Go right and left again at the stairs.
You'll come to a corridor.

1474
01:54:05,272 --> 01:54:07,263
This could be bad.

1475
01:54:07,312 --> 01:54:08,631
(Water gurgling)

1476
01:54:11,192 --> 01:54:12,864
Oh, shit.

1477
01:54:12,912 --> 01:54:14,425
Oh, shit!

1478
01:54:18,872 --> 01:54:20,385
Excuse me!

1479
01:54:20,432 --> 01:54:23,424
- Crewman: The lifts are closed.
- I do not care...

1480
01:54:23,472 --> 01:54:24,871
The lifts are...

1481
01:54:24,912 --> 01:54:28,951
I'm sorry, miss,
but the lifts are closed.

1482
01:54:28,992 --> 01:54:32,985
I'm through being polite,
goddamn it! Now take me down!

1483
01:54:33,272 --> 01:54:34,625
"E" deck.

1484
01:54:38,192 --> 01:54:40,706
Come on... Come on, come on...

1485
01:54:57,392 --> 01:54:58,825
I'm going back up!

1486
01:54:58,872 --> 01:55:00,021
No!

1487
01:55:00,072 --> 01:55:01,266
No! No!

1488
01:55:01,312 --> 01:55:03,462
Miss, wait!

1489
01:55:04,312 --> 01:55:07,065
Come back! I'm going back up!

1490
01:55:07,112 --> 01:55:08,306
I'm going back up!

1491
01:55:17,112 --> 01:55:19,103
Crew passage...

1492
01:55:19,432 --> 01:55:21,423
Crew passage.

1493
01:55:40,352 --> 01:55:41,865
Jack!

1494
01:55:45,032 --> 01:55:46,750
Jack!

1495
01:55:50,832 --> 01:55:52,231
Jack!

1496
01:55:52,592 --> 01:55:54,583
Rose!

1497
01:55:55,392 --> 01:55:56,711
Jack!

1498
01:55:56,752 --> 01:55:58,310
Rose, I'm in here!

1499
01:55:58,352 --> 01:56:00,263
- I'm in here!
- Jack!

1500
01:56:00,312 --> 01:56:01,665
I'm in here!

1501
01:56:01,712 --> 01:56:02,940
- Jack!
- Rose!

1502
01:56:02,992 --> 01:56:04,710
Jack! Jack!

1503
01:56:04,752 --> 01:56:05,787
I'm sorry!

1504
01:56:05,832 --> 01:56:07,823
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

1505
01:56:09,152 --> 01:56:12,940
- Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
- I know! I know, I know, I know!

1506
01:56:12,992 --> 01:56:15,904
Rose, you have to find
a spare key, all right?

1507
01:56:15,952 --> 01:56:17,385
Look in that cabinet.

1508
01:56:18,632 --> 01:56:21,100
It's a little silver one, Rose.

1509
01:56:21,152 --> 01:56:22,870
Silver...

1510
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:24,550
These are all brass!

1511
01:56:24,592 --> 01:56:26,901
Check right here, Rose.

1512
01:56:30,072 --> 01:56:31,710
Rose...

1513
01:56:32,712 --> 01:56:34,828
How did you find out I didn't do it?

1514
01:56:34,872 --> 01:56:36,863
I didn't.

1515
01:56:37,072 --> 01:56:39,745
I just realised I already knew.

1516
01:56:41,032 --> 01:56:43,307
Keep looking!

1517
01:56:49,752 --> 01:56:51,310
No key.

1518
01:56:51,352 --> 01:56:54,264
- There's no key!
- Rose, listen.

1519
01:56:54,312 --> 01:56:56,109
You have to go find help.

1520
01:56:56,152 --> 01:56:57,665
It'll be all right.

1521
01:57:02,832 --> 01:57:04,584
I'll be right back.

1522
01:57:10,752 --> 01:57:13,061
I'll just wait here.

1523
01:57:25,792 --> 01:57:28,147
Hello, is there anyone here?

1524
01:57:28,552 --> 01:57:30,031
Hello?

1525
01:57:30,072 --> 01:57:32,632
Is there anybody down here?

1526
01:57:33,152 --> 01:57:35,063
We need help! Hello!

1527
01:57:35,112 --> 01:57:36,864
Damn it!

1528
01:57:43,792 --> 01:57:47,671
Can anybody hear me! Please!
Hello! Hello!

1529
01:57:48,432 --> 01:57:50,263
Oh, thank God!

1530
01:57:50,312 --> 01:57:54,146
I need your help. There's a man
back here and... Wait!

1531
01:57:58,672 --> 01:58:00,549
Hello?

1532
01:58:10,592 --> 01:58:12,583
(Loud rumbling)

1533
01:58:13,592 --> 01:58:15,583
(Panting)

1534
01:58:23,912 --> 01:58:25,550
Hello?

1535
01:58:25,592 --> 01:58:30,143
- Miss, you shouldn't be here now.
- Please, I need your help.

1536
01:58:30,192 --> 01:58:33,150
There is a man down here
and he is trapped!

1537
01:58:33,192 --> 01:58:35,228
- No need to panic.
- I'm not panicking!

1538
01:58:35,272 --> 01:58:38,867
You're going the wrong way!
Let go of me! Listen!

1539
01:58:43,912 --> 01:58:45,664
To hell with you.

1540
01:58:47,832 --> 01:58:49,823
(Ship creaking)

1541
01:59:04,392 --> 01:59:06,383
(Crewman shouting orders)

1542
01:59:07,512 --> 01:59:09,503
Lower away!

1543
01:59:15,672 --> 01:59:17,663
Oh, God...

1544
01:59:21,672 --> 01:59:23,663
Oh, my God...

1545
01:59:41,952 --> 01:59:43,544
(Gasps)

1546
02:00:09,712 --> 02:00:11,350
Jack!

1547
02:00:11,392 --> 02:00:13,110
Rose!

1548
02:00:13,152 --> 02:00:15,143
Will this work?

1549
02:00:16,032 --> 02:00:18,671
I guess we'll find out. Come on.

1550
02:00:20,912 --> 02:00:22,948
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1551
02:00:22,992 --> 02:00:24,789
Try some practice swings.

1552
02:00:29,752 --> 02:00:33,381
Good. Try to hit the same mark
again, Rose. You can do it.

1553
02:00:39,672 --> 02:00:42,140
Okay. That's enough practice.

1554
02:00:42,192 --> 02:00:43,944
Come on, Rose. You can do it.

1555
02:00:43,992 --> 02:00:47,985
Listen, just hit it really hard
and really fast.

1556
02:00:49,512 --> 02:00:52,231
Wait! Open your hands up
a little more.

1557
02:00:52,272 --> 02:00:54,547
- Like that?
- Right.

1558
02:00:54,592 --> 02:00:57,311
Listen, Rose... I trust you.

1559
02:01:01,432 --> 02:01:03,343
Go!

1560
02:01:07,912 --> 02:01:09,391
You did it!

1561
02:01:09,432 --> 02:01:11,866
Come on, let's go!

1562
02:01:11,912 --> 02:01:14,267
Oh, shit, this is cold! Oh, shit!

1563
02:01:14,312 --> 02:01:16,064
Shit! Shit!

1564
02:01:20,952 --> 02:01:22,351
This is the way out.

1565
02:01:22,392 --> 02:01:26,146
We have to find another way. Come on.

1566
02:01:26,192 --> 02:01:27,261
Pull!

1567
02:01:27,312 --> 02:01:28,984
(Orchestra playing)

1568
02:01:29,032 --> 02:01:30,101
Pull!

1569
02:01:30,152 --> 02:01:32,586
Put your backs into it! Pull!

1570
02:01:36,912 --> 02:01:38,470
Pull!

1571
02:01:38,512 --> 02:01:42,300
Now there's something
you don't see every day.

1572
02:02:02,712 --> 02:02:06,864
What's this luggage doing here?
Get rid of it! We need the room!

1573
02:02:06,912 --> 02:02:08,903
(Crewman giving orders)

1574
02:02:12,032 --> 02:02:13,670
Keep calm!

1575
02:02:14,712 --> 02:02:18,102
Move along there. Make more room.
That's right. Look sharp.

1576
02:02:20,112 --> 02:02:22,945
- Lovejoy!
- She's not on the starboard side.

1577
02:02:22,992 --> 02:02:27,508
We're running out of time and this
martinet isn't letting any men on.

1578
02:02:27,552 --> 02:02:30,020
There's one on the other side
letting men on.

1579
02:02:30,072 --> 02:02:34,588
Then that's our play. We'll need
some insurance first. Come on.

1580
02:02:34,712 --> 02:02:36,509
(Banging)

1581
02:02:36,552 --> 02:02:38,747
This way. All the way down here.

1582
02:02:40,672 --> 02:02:43,982
Here! What do you think you're doing?

1583
02:02:44,032 --> 02:02:47,741
You'll have to pay for that!
That's White Star Line property!

1584
02:02:47,792 --> 02:02:49,066
Shut up!

1585
02:02:50,592 --> 02:02:54,949
Will you hold the boat a moment?
I just have to run back to my room...

1586
02:02:54,992 --> 02:02:57,142
Sit down!

1587
02:02:57,192 --> 02:03:01,185
Mr Lightoller, why are the boats
being launched half full?

1588
02:03:01,232 --> 02:03:05,544
- Not now, Mr Andrews.
- 20 or so in a boat built for 65...

1589
02:03:05,592 --> 02:03:07,867
..and I saw one boat with only 12! 12!

1590
02:03:07,912 --> 02:03:12,349
We weren't sure of the weight,
Mr Andrews. These boats may buckle.

1591
02:03:12,392 --> 02:03:13,427
Rubbish!

1592
02:03:13,472 --> 02:03:16,350
They were tested in Belfast
with 70 men!

1593
02:03:16,392 --> 02:03:20,590
Now fill these boats, Mr Lightoller,
for God's sake, man!

1594
02:03:25,872 --> 02:03:28,750
I need more women and children, please!

1595
02:03:32,512 --> 02:03:35,948
Crewman: Get back in there.
This is not an exit.

1596
02:03:35,992 --> 02:03:39,621
- Get back in there.
- This is not an exit!

1597
02:03:40,032 --> 02:03:43,866
You can't keep us locked in here!
The ship's bloody sinking!

1598
02:03:43,912 --> 02:03:45,903
Bring forward the women!

1599
02:03:45,952 --> 02:03:47,943
Unlock the gates.

1600
02:03:48,792 --> 02:03:50,669
Women only!

1601
02:03:50,712 --> 02:03:52,464
No men!

1602
02:03:52,512 --> 02:03:54,309
No men!

1603
02:03:54,352 --> 02:03:56,343
(Yelling)

1604
02:03:58,112 --> 02:04:00,103
Get back!

1605
02:04:02,432 --> 02:04:04,343
Lock the gates!

1606
02:04:04,392 --> 02:04:07,190
Get them back from those gates!

1607
02:04:07,232 --> 02:04:09,143
Don't touch the gates!

1608
02:04:11,672 --> 02:04:15,028
There are women and children
down here!

1609
02:04:15,072 --> 02:04:17,586
Let us up so we can have a chance!

1610
02:04:17,632 --> 02:04:19,623
Get back!

1611
02:04:21,952 --> 02:04:23,510
- Jack!
- Tommy!

1612
02:04:23,552 --> 02:04:25,747
- Can we get out?
- It's hopeless that way!

1613
02:04:25,792 --> 02:04:27,464
Whatever we do,
we've gotta do it fast.

1614
02:04:27,512 --> 02:04:28,911
Jack!

1615
02:04:28,952 --> 02:04:30,510
Fabrizio!

1616
02:04:30,552 --> 02:04:32,349
The boats are all gone.

1617
02:04:32,392 --> 02:04:35,464
- This whole place is flooding.
- There is niente this way.

1618
02:04:35,512 --> 02:04:38,106
All right. Let's go this way. Come on.

1619
02:04:42,952 --> 02:04:44,783
I make my own luck.

1620
02:04:44,832 --> 02:04:46,788
So do I.

1621
02:04:54,352 --> 02:04:55,910
Come on!

1622
02:04:55,952 --> 02:04:58,068
No, come on. Let's go this way.

1623
02:05:00,152 --> 02:05:02,143
(Speaking Arabic)

1624
02:05:06,312 --> 02:05:07,904
This way!

1625
02:05:07,952 --> 02:05:11,740
Go back to the main stairwell
and everything will be sorted out there.

1626
02:05:11,792 --> 02:05:13,111
The hell it will!

1627
02:05:13,152 --> 02:05:15,143
It will get sorted out back there.

1628
02:05:15,192 --> 02:05:16,545
Go back to the main stairwell.

1629
02:05:16,592 --> 02:05:18,901
- Open the gate.
- Go back...

1630
02:05:18,952 --> 02:05:22,024
- Open the gate now!
- Go back down the main stairwell!

1631
02:05:23,912 --> 02:05:27,029
Goddamn it! Son of a bitch!

1632
02:05:27,072 --> 02:05:28,505
Open the damn gate!

1633
02:05:28,552 --> 02:05:30,747
Go back!

1634
02:05:32,592 --> 02:05:36,585
- Fabri, Tommy. Give me a hand here!
- Move aside! Move aside!

1635
02:05:36,632 --> 02:05:38,270
Pull!

1636
02:05:39,112 --> 02:05:41,103
- Move aside!
- Put that down!

1637
02:05:41,192 --> 02:05:42,466
Move aside!

1638
02:05:42,512 --> 02:05:44,946
- One! Two!
- Stop that!

1639
02:05:44,992 --> 02:05:46,186
Three!

1640
02:05:48,272 --> 02:05:49,307
Again!

1641
02:05:51,192 --> 02:05:52,227
Let's go!

1642
02:05:53,712 --> 02:05:54,986
Let's go, Rose.

1643
02:05:55,072 --> 02:05:58,348
You can't go up there!
You can't do this!

1644
02:06:02,792 --> 02:06:05,750
Lightoller: Keep order! Keep order here!

1645
02:06:05,792 --> 02:06:08,864
Back! Back! Back!

1646
02:06:09,832 --> 02:06:11,026
(Screaming)

1647
02:06:12,792 --> 02:06:14,191
Hold on to her!

1648
02:06:15,632 --> 02:06:16,951
Pull her in!

1649
02:06:16,992 --> 02:06:19,950
Get back, I say!

1650
02:06:19,992 --> 02:06:22,222
Or I'll shoot you all like dogs!

1651
02:06:22,272 --> 02:06:24,263
Keep order here!

1652
02:06:24,752 --> 02:06:26,822
Keep order, I say.

1653
02:06:27,272 --> 02:06:30,070
Mr Lowe, man this boat.

1654
02:06:33,832 --> 02:06:36,266
Lowe: Is everybody all right?

1655
02:06:36,312 --> 02:06:38,189
Nobody panic.

1656
02:06:43,472 --> 02:06:45,349
Crewman: Stay back!

1657
02:06:45,392 --> 02:06:48,589
- We're too late.
- There are more boats at the front.

1658
02:06:48,632 --> 02:06:52,261
Stay with this one.
Murdoch seems to be quite practical.

1659
02:06:52,312 --> 02:06:54,143
(Women screaming)

1660
02:07:05,952 --> 02:07:07,829
Lowe: Sit down!

1661
02:07:08,312 --> 02:07:10,303
Stay back, you lot.

1662
02:07:10,392 --> 02:07:13,668
Stay back! Stay back,
the lot of you! Stay back!

1663
02:07:13,712 --> 02:07:14,667
(Gunshots)

1664
02:07:14,712 --> 02:07:18,705
It's starting to fall apart.
We don't have much time.

1665
02:07:19,752 --> 02:07:21,743
Mr Murdoch?

1666
02:07:21,872 --> 02:07:22,987
Mr Hockley...

1667
02:07:23,072 --> 02:07:24,505
You two, with me, now!

1668
02:07:24,552 --> 02:07:28,340
I'm a businessman, as you know,
and I've a business proposition for you.

1669
02:07:28,392 --> 02:07:31,828
Crewman: Easy now! All together!

1670
02:07:31,872 --> 02:07:34,784
Lower away! Lower away!

1671
02:07:34,832 --> 02:07:36,823
Jack: Come on, Rose.

1672
02:07:39,552 --> 02:07:41,543
The boats are gone!

1673
02:07:45,112 --> 02:07:47,865
Colonel, are there any boats
on that side?

1674
02:07:47,912 --> 02:07:51,791
No, miss, but there are a couple
of boats all the way forward.

1675
02:07:57,312 --> 02:08:01,021
What's the use?
Nobody's listening to us, anyway.

1676
02:08:01,072 --> 02:08:03,870
They don't listen to us at dinner, either.

1677
02:08:03,912 --> 02:08:05,868
Come on, let's play. Keep us warm.

1678
02:08:05,912 --> 02:08:07,664
"Orpheus".

1679
02:08:07,872 --> 02:08:11,547
(Playing fast music from
"Orpheus In The Underworld")

1680
02:08:11,592 --> 02:08:14,823
Music to drown by.
Now I know I'm in first class!

1681
02:08:19,792 --> 02:08:23,341
- Where is everyone?
- They're all still aft, sir.

1682
02:08:25,232 --> 02:08:28,144
We have an understanding, then,
Mr Murdoch?

1683
02:08:38,272 --> 02:08:40,263
(Everyone shouting)

1684
02:08:41,352 --> 02:08:43,343
(Gunshots)

1685
02:08:43,392 --> 02:08:46,509
Women and children only!

1686
02:08:46,552 --> 02:08:48,986
Get back! Step back, sir.

1687
02:08:49,152 --> 02:08:52,064
Come through, madam.
This way. Step back, sir.

1688
02:08:52,112 --> 02:08:54,751
You better check the other side.

1689
02:08:54,792 --> 02:08:56,384
Go!

1690
02:08:58,072 --> 02:09:03,271
Murdoch: Any more women
and children? Any children?

1691
02:09:03,312 --> 02:09:06,861
I found her on the other side
waiting for a boat.

1692
02:09:06,992 --> 02:09:08,345
With him.

1693
02:09:08,392 --> 02:09:11,941
- Any more women and children?
- They're all aboard.

1694
02:09:11,992 --> 02:09:14,062
Anyone else, then!

1695
02:09:14,112 --> 02:09:16,945
- Anyone else!
- Hurry along.

1696
02:09:20,472 --> 02:09:22,428
Stand by the falls.

1697
02:09:22,472 --> 02:09:25,430
Oh, goddamn it all to hell!

1698
02:09:27,192 --> 02:09:28,591
Shit!

1699
02:09:28,632 --> 02:09:30,350
Fire!

1700
02:09:30,392 --> 02:09:33,031
Sir! Sir, you can't go through here.

1701
02:09:33,072 --> 02:09:35,063
Sir, you can't go through.

1702
02:09:36,392 --> 02:09:38,906
Yes, yes, splendid. Right.

1703
02:09:39,952 --> 02:09:41,624
Right.

1704
02:09:42,112 --> 02:09:44,865
Murdoch: Prepare to lower!

1705
02:09:46,832 --> 02:09:48,823
Ready on the left.

1706
02:09:53,472 --> 02:09:55,463
Take them down.

1707
02:09:59,672 --> 02:10:01,663
Keep it steady.

1708
02:10:02,952 --> 02:10:05,546
Both sides together. Steady...

1709
02:10:05,912 --> 02:10:08,062
Keep it steady.

1710
02:10:08,352 --> 02:10:09,785
Give her to me.

1711
02:10:09,872 --> 02:10:10,987
Daddy...

1712
02:10:11,152 --> 02:10:14,462
It'll be fine, darling.
Don't you worry.

1713
02:10:14,592 --> 02:10:17,948
It's goodbye for a little while.
Only a little while.

1714
02:10:17,992 --> 02:10:22,622
There's another boat for daddies.
This one's for mummies and children.

1715
02:10:22,672 --> 02:10:25,232
Hold mummy's hand and be a good girl.

1716
02:10:25,272 --> 02:10:28,469
- I'm not going without you.
- You have to... Now!

1717
02:10:28,512 --> 02:10:29,501
No, Jack.

1718
02:10:29,552 --> 02:10:32,225
- Get in the boat, Rose.
- No, Jack.

1719
02:10:32,312 --> 02:10:34,109
Get on the boat!

1720
02:10:34,152 --> 02:10:36,507
Yes, get on the boat, Rose.

1721
02:10:38,592 --> 02:10:41,823
My God, look at you.
You look a fright!

1722
02:10:41,872 --> 02:10:43,430
Here.

1723
02:10:44,392 --> 02:10:46,189
Put this on.

1724
02:10:46,232 --> 02:10:47,790
Come.

1725
02:10:51,832 --> 02:10:55,745
- Go on. I'll get the next one.
- No! Not without you!

1726
02:10:55,832 --> 02:10:59,871
I'll be fine. I'm a survivor, all right?
Don't worry about me.

1727
02:10:59,912 --> 02:11:01,391
Now go on, get on.

1728
02:11:01,432 --> 02:11:05,186
I have an arrangement
with an officer on the ship.

1729
02:11:05,232 --> 02:11:07,507
Jack and I can get off safely.

1730
02:11:07,552 --> 02:11:08,667
See?

1731
02:11:08,712 --> 02:11:11,590
- Got my own boat to catch.
- Hurry!

1732
02:11:11,632 --> 02:11:13,190
They're almost full.

1733
02:11:14,552 --> 02:11:16,543
Step aboard, miss.

1734
02:11:17,992 --> 02:11:20,187
Step aboard, please.

1735
02:11:20,272 --> 02:11:23,309
(Crewman)
Keep back. Keep back, I say!

1736
02:11:23,992 --> 02:11:25,983
Clear the row, please.

1737
02:11:27,632 --> 02:11:28,860
Lower away!

1738
02:11:32,192 --> 02:11:33,511
Crewman: Slowly...

1739
02:11:33,752 --> 02:11:35,822
Keep going, keep going.

1740
02:11:36,112 --> 02:11:38,580
And lower away evenly, lads.

1741
02:11:38,712 --> 02:11:41,704
Easy... Lower away.

1742
02:11:41,752 --> 02:11:43,424
You're a good liar.

1743
02:11:43,472 --> 02:11:45,463
Almost as good as you.

1744
02:11:45,552 --> 02:11:48,862
Crewman: Easy now... and lower away.

1745
02:11:49,992 --> 02:11:53,985
There's no, uh...
There's no arrangement, is there?

1746
02:11:54,032 --> 02:11:56,102
No, there is.

1747
02:11:56,472 --> 02:11:59,066
Not that you'll benefit much from it.

1748
02:12:00,752 --> 02:12:02,743
I always win, Jack.

1749
02:12:02,872 --> 02:12:04,863
One way or another.

1750
02:12:07,272 --> 02:12:09,263
Crewman: Easy...

1751
02:12:10,672 --> 02:12:12,583
Even, lads.

1752
02:12:12,672 --> 02:12:15,061
Keep going, keep going.

1753
02:13:00,752 --> 02:13:01,707
Rose!

1754
02:13:01,752 --> 02:13:03,868
(Passengers yelling)

1755
02:13:04,672 --> 02:13:06,822
- Stop her!
- What are you doing!

1756
02:13:06,872 --> 02:13:08,749
Stop her!

1757
02:13:08,792 --> 02:13:10,191
No!

1758
02:13:27,472 --> 02:13:29,269
Rose!

1759
02:13:31,712 --> 02:13:34,704
You're so stupid! Why'd you do that?

1760
02:13:34,752 --> 02:13:36,743
You're so stupid, Rose!

1761
02:13:37,912 --> 02:13:40,107
Why did you do that? Why?

1762
02:13:40,512 --> 02:13:42,468
You jump, I jump, right?

1763
02:13:43,472 --> 02:13:45,064
Right.

1764
02:13:47,232 --> 02:13:49,507
Oh, God, I couldn't go.

1765
02:13:49,552 --> 02:13:51,543
I couldn't go, Jack.

1766
02:13:51,592 --> 02:13:54,629
It's all right.
We'll think of something.

1767
02:13:54,672 --> 02:13:56,947
Rose: At least I'm with you.

1768
02:14:09,272 --> 02:14:10,421
Come on!

1769
02:14:12,112 --> 02:14:13,465
Come on!

1770
02:14:13,512 --> 02:14:15,628
Come on! Move!

1771
02:14:21,632 --> 02:14:23,145
Come on!

1772
02:14:30,112 --> 02:14:31,511
Move!

1773
02:14:38,072 --> 02:14:40,950
Come on, Rose. Come on.

1774
02:14:40,992 --> 02:14:41,742
(Gunshot)

1775
02:14:41,792 --> 02:14:43,783
Rose, come on!

1776
02:14:45,592 --> 02:14:46,581
Move, Rose!

1777
02:14:49,392 --> 02:14:50,268
Go!

1778
02:14:56,432 --> 02:14:58,992
(Creaking)

1779
02:15:00,672 --> 02:15:04,301
I hope you enjoy your time together!

1780
02:15:14,752 --> 02:15:16,549
(Laughter)

1781
02:15:16,872 --> 02:15:19,261
What could possibly be funny?

1782
02:15:20,392 --> 02:15:22,952
I put the diamond in the coat...

1783
02:15:24,712 --> 02:15:27,101
..and I put the coat on her!

1784
02:15:27,632 --> 02:15:29,270
Come on!

1785
02:15:43,192 --> 02:15:45,865
(Child crying)

1786
02:15:48,672 --> 02:15:51,345
(Wailing)

1787
02:15:51,512 --> 02:15:53,503
We can't leave him.

1788
02:15:56,432 --> 02:15:58,343
All right, come on!

1789
02:16:15,192 --> 02:16:16,420
Go back!

1790
02:16:18,712 --> 02:16:20,748
(Yelling in Czech)

1791
02:16:26,112 --> 02:16:28,990
It's the wrong way! Come back!

1792
02:16:35,152 --> 02:16:36,870
Go!

1793
02:16:52,752 --> 02:16:54,231
Jack!

1794
02:16:54,272 --> 02:16:55,671
Rose!

1795
02:17:07,392 --> 02:17:09,110
This way!

1796
02:17:17,152 --> 02:17:18,790
Come on.

1797
02:17:18,952 --> 02:17:20,590
Give me your hand.

1798
02:17:29,592 --> 02:17:31,264
Oh, God!

1799
02:17:34,432 --> 02:17:35,865
Help!

Wait! Please!

Don't leave! Please! Get more help!

1815
02:18:38,792 --> 02:18:41,431
I got 'em! Which one is it, Rose?

1816
02:18:41,472 --> 02:18:43,906
The sharp one, try the sharp one.

1817
02:18:44,032 --> 02:18:45,147
Hurry, Jack.

1818
02:18:48,912 --> 02:18:50,504
Oh, no!

Hurry, Jack.

1820

Crewman: Keep on rocking!

1828
02:19:35,992 --> 02:19:38,381
Oars in place! Get an oar under it!

1829
02:19:38,432 --> 02:19:41,629
Women and children only, damn you!

1830
02:19:41,672 --> 02:19:44,266
Crewman: Hold it! Hold it!

1831

(Men yelling)

1832
02:19:54,912 --> 02:19:59,588
Get these davits cranked in!
Then get the falls hooked up!

1833
02:20:08,152 --> 02:20:10,143
Murdoch: Stay back!

1834
02:20:10,952 --> 02:20:13,182
Mommy...!

1835
02:20:19,472 --> 02:20:21,463
Keep going up!

1837
02:20:26,912 --> 02:20:28,504
Stay back!

1838
02:20:28,552 --> 02:20:31,146
Give us a chance to live,
you limey bastard!

1839
02:20:31,192 --> 02:20:33,660
I'll shoot any man
who tries to get past me!

1840

Bastard!

1841
02:20:35,032 --> 02:20:36,147
Get back!

1842
02:20:36,192 --> 02:20:37,784
We had a deal, damn you.

1843
02:20:40,672 --> 02:20:44,506
Your money can't save you
any more than it can save me.

1844
02:20:44,552 --> 02:20:46,031
Get back!

1845
02:20:46,072 --> 02:20:48,791

1849
02:20:55,632 --> 02:20:56,951
No! Tommy...

1850
02:20:56,992 --> 02:20:59,062
Bastardo!

Oh, no! Oh, no...!

1852
02:21:02,352 --> 02:21:05,867
Oh, no...! Tommy...!

1853
02:21:15,832 --> 02:21:16,867
No!

1854
02:21:22,872 --> 02:21:24,863
Stand back, damn you!

1857
02:21:40,352 --> 02:21:42,343
I have a child!

1858
02:21:42,392 --> 02:21:44,542
- I have a child!
- Clear a path here!

1859
02:21:44,632 --> 02:21:47,271
Please, I have a child!

1860
02:21:47,312 --> 02:21:50,224
Please, I'm all she has in the world.

1861
02:21:50,272 --> 02:21:52,263
Go on.

1862
02:21:53,112 --> 02:21:54,704
Step back!

1863
02:21:54,752 --> 02:21:56,743
Here, give her to me.

1864
02:21:59,872 --> 02:22:01,828
Give her here.

1865
02:22:01,872 --> 02:22:03,100
(Child wailing)

1866
02:22:03,152 --> 02:22:04,983
There, there.

1867
02:22:08,072 --> 02:22:09,790
Wait, wait, wait.

1868
02:22:09,832 --> 02:22:11,629
Mr Andrews...

1869
02:22:12,832 --> 02:22:14,231
Rose.

1870
02:22:15,792 --> 02:22:18,352
Won't you even make a try for it?

1871
02:22:20,712 --> 02:22:25,502
I'm sorry that I didn't build you
a stronger ship, young Rose.

1872
02:22:25,712 --> 02:22:27,350
It's going fast.

1873
02:22:27,392 --> 02:22:29,064
We have to move.

1874
02:22:29,112 --> 02:22:30,704
Wait.

1875
02:22:32,192 --> 02:22:34,183
Good luck to you, Rose.

1876
02:22:35,832 --> 02:22:37,584
And to you.

1877
02:22:48,312 --> 02:22:52,271
Mr Guggenheim...
These are for you, Mr Guggenheim.

1878
02:22:52,312 --> 02:22:53,791
No, thank you.

1879
02:22:53,912 --> 02:22:58,110
We are dressed in our best and
are prepared to go down as gentlemen.

1880
02:22:58,152 --> 02:22:59,870
But we would like a brandy.

1881
02:23:10,792 --> 02:23:12,305
Capitan.

1882
02:23:12,352 --> 02:23:14,741
Capitan, where should I go?
Please...

1883
02:23:19,232 --> 02:23:21,223
Crewman: Captain!

1884
02:23:21,272 --> 02:23:23,832
Captain... Sir.

1885
02:23:43,872 --> 02:23:47,262
(Orchestra still playing)

1886
02:23:52,792 --> 02:23:55,511
Right... That's it, then.

1887
02:23:55,552 --> 02:23:58,305
Goodbye, Wally. Good luck.

1888
02:23:58,352 --> 02:24:00,343
So long, old chap.

1889
02:24:06,952 --> 02:24:10,262
(Starts playing
"Nearer My God To Thee")

1890
02:25:11,272 --> 02:25:16,300
And so they lived happily together
for 300 years...

1891
02:25:16,352 --> 02:25:19,230
..in the land of Tir Na Nog.

1892
02:25:19,272 --> 02:25:22,344
Land of eternal youth and beauty.

1893
02:25:55,032 --> 02:25:57,341
There's no time!

1894
02:25:57,392 --> 02:26:00,907
Cut those falls!
Cut 'em! Cut 'em if you have to!

1895
02:26:00,952 --> 02:26:04,069
I need a knife! I need a knife!

1896
02:26:06,552 --> 02:26:08,782
Cut her loose!

1897
02:26:19,352 --> 02:26:21,263
Cut those bloody falls!

1898
02:27:06,152 --> 02:27:11,067
Gentlemen, it has been a privilege
playing with you tonight.

1899
02:28:08,712 --> 02:28:12,500
We have to stay on the ship
as long as possible! Come on!

1900
02:28:22,992 --> 02:28:25,552
Jack: This way. Over the rail!

1901
02:28:27,472 --> 02:28:29,906
Come on, Rose. Jump!

1902
02:28:32,512 --> 02:28:34,104
Come on!

1903
02:28:40,232 --> 02:28:41,506
(Screaming)

1904
02:28:58,952 --> 02:29:00,943
(Gasping)

1905
02:29:04,712 --> 02:29:07,180
Jack: I got you. Jump!

1906
02:29:08,552 --> 02:29:10,543
I've got you, miss!

1907
02:29:11,632 --> 02:29:13,224
Jack!

1908
02:29:14,592 --> 02:29:16,230
Cal: Get back!

1909
02:29:20,152 --> 02:29:22,268
(Cables snapping)

1910
02:29:24,552 --> 02:29:26,031
(Metal groaning)

1911
02:29:44,432 --> 02:29:46,423
No! You'll swamp us!

1912
02:29:50,112 --> 02:29:52,387
(Screaming)

1913
02:29:58,632 --> 02:30:01,704
Though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

1914
02:30:01,752 --> 02:30:04,585
You wanna walk a little faster
through that valley?!

1915
02:30:26,032 --> 02:30:27,624
Row!

1916
02:30:27,672 --> 02:30:29,663
Pull together!

1917
02:30:48,192 --> 02:30:49,466
(Screams)

1918
02:30:51,912 --> 02:30:54,380
Holy Mary, Mother of God,...

1919
02:30:54,432 --> 02:30:57,981
..pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death. Amen.

1920
02:30:58,032 --> 02:30:59,465
Hail Mary, full of grace...

1921
02:30:59,512 --> 02:31:01,389
This way.

1922
02:31:09,032 --> 02:31:10,624
Come on!

1923
02:31:10,672 --> 02:31:12,469
Come on!

1924
02:31:21,272 --> 02:31:23,388
I saw a new heaven and a new earth...

1925
02:31:23,432 --> 02:31:27,550
..when the first heaven and
the first earth had passed away...

1926
02:31:27,592 --> 02:31:29,822
..and there was no more sea.

1927
02:31:35,392 --> 02:31:39,510
It'll be over soon.
It'll all be over soon.

1928
02:31:43,752 --> 02:31:47,631
And he shall dwell with them
and they shall be his people...

1929
02:31:47,672 --> 02:31:50,266
..and God himself shall be with them.

1930
02:31:52,552 --> 02:31:54,383
Jack,...

1931
02:31:54,432 --> 02:31:57,230
..this is where we first met.

1932
02:32:03,192 --> 02:32:06,628
And God shall wipe away
all the tears from their eyes.

1933
02:32:06,672 --> 02:32:08,708
And there shall be no more death.

1934
02:32:08,752 --> 02:32:11,664
Neither shall there be sorrow or crying.

1935
02:32:11,712 --> 02:32:15,102
Neither shall there be
any more pain...

1936
02:32:15,152 --> 02:32:18,303
..for the former world has passed away.

1937
02:32:31,512 --> 02:32:33,946
Bloody pull faster, and pull!

1938
02:32:37,032 --> 02:32:39,023
(Screaming)

1939
02:32:56,192 --> 02:32:57,705
Hang on, Miss Trudy!

1940
02:32:57,752 --> 02:32:59,708
(Screaming)

1941
02:32:59,872 --> 02:33:01,863
(Glass shattering)

1942
02:33:20,712 --> 02:33:22,065

1943
02:33:25,592 --> 02:33:29,028
Man: Help me! Please, save me!

1944
02:33:31,072 --> 02:33:32,187
Woman: Help!

1945
02:33:32,232 --> 02:33:34,223
Jack: Hold on real tight!

1946
02:33:34,832 --> 02:33:36,743
(Distant screaming)

1947
02:33:36,792 --> 02:33:38,783
(Woman sobbing)

1948
02:33:44,512 --> 02:33:48,983
(Distant screaming)

1949
02:33:50,152 --> 02:33:51,551
God Almighty!

1950
02:33:59,232 --> 02:34:02,463
Crewman: Get those breakers in!
Keep 'em in!

1951
02:34:02,592 --> 02:34:04,583
(Crackling)

1952
02:34:06,152 --> 02:34:07,505

1957
02:35:17,312 --> 02:35:19,303
We have to move!

1958
02:35:24,392 --> 02:35:27,304
Give me your hand.
I'll pull you over.

1959
02:35:27,352 --> 02:35:29,912
Give me your hand!

1960
02:35:29,952 --> 02:35:32,910
I've got you. I won't let go.

1961
02:35:32,952 --> 02:35:35,341
Come on, I've got you!

1962
02:35:44,632 --> 02:35:47,783
- What's happening, Jack?
- I don't know!

1963
02:35:56,472 --> 02:35:58,463
- Hold on!
- Jack!

1964
02:35:58,512 --> 02:36:01,185
Man: Help me, please!

1965
02:36:01,312 --> 02:36:02,870
Someone help me!

1966

Rose: Oh, God! Oh, God!

1972
02:36:53,352 --> 02:36:55,422
Hold on!

Oh, God! Oh...

1974

The ship is gonna suck us down.

1975
02:37:12,352 --> 02:37:14,582
Take a deep breath when I say.

1976
02:37:18,752 --> 02:37:21,903
Kick for the surface
and keep kicking.

1977
02:37:21,952 --> 02:37:24,705
Do not let go of my hand.

1978
02:37:30,632 --> 02:37:33,430
We're gonna make it, Rose. Trust me.

1979
02:37:33,512 --> 02:37:35,707
I trust you.

1980
02:37:38,312 --> 02:37:41,509
Ready? Ready?

1981
02:37:41,592 --> 02:37:43,310
Now!

Jack! Jack!

1990
02:38:55,672 --> 02:38:56,627
No!

1991
02:38:57,872 --> 02:38:59,430
Jack!

1992
02:38:59,472 --> 02:39:01,428
Rose!

1993
02:39:01,792 --> 02:39:04,101
Get off her! Get off her!

1994
02:39:06,432 --> 02:39:08,866
- Rose!
- Jack!

1995
02:39:08,912 --> 02:39:11,301
Swim, Rose! I need you to swim!

1996
02:39:14,392 --> 02:39:16,508
Keep swimming!

1997
02:39:20,112 --> 02:39:22,706
- It's so cold!
- Swim, Rose!

1998
02:39:27,272 --> 02:39:29,661
Come on... here...

1999
02:39:29,992 --> 02:39:32,187
Keep swimming... come on.

2000
02:39:34,512 --> 02:39:36,867
Here, get on it.

2001
02:39:36,992 --> 02:39:38,983
Get on top.

2002
02:39:45,472 --> 02:39:47,463
Come on, Rose.

2003
02:39:56,632 --> 02:39:58,304
Stay on it, Rose.

2004
02:39:58,352 --> 02:39:59,751
Jack...

2005
02:40:18,752 --> 02:40:20,743
You'll be all right now.

2006
02:40:22,832 --> 02:40:24,823
You'll be all right now.

2007
02:40:25,832 --> 02:40:27,584
(Whistle blows)

2008
02:40:27,632 --> 02:40:29,827
(Whistle)

2009
02:40:30,792 --> 02:40:32,783
Crewman: Return...

2010
02:40:32,832 --> 02:40:34,550
..the boats!

2011
02:40:37,592 --> 02:40:42,029
The boats are coming back for us, Rose.
Hold on just a bit longer.

2012
02:40:42,072 --> 02:40:45,382
They... had to row away
from the suction...

2013
02:40:45,432 --> 02:40:47,992
..but... now they'll be coming back.

2014
02:40:48,032 --> 02:40:50,830
Woman: Come back!

2015
02:40:50,872 --> 02:40:55,309
- For God's sake!
- Please! Help us!

2016
02:40:55,352 --> 02:40:57,070
(Faint cries in distance)

2017
02:40:57,112 --> 02:40:59,626
Come back! For God's sake!

2018
02:40:59,712 --> 02:41:04,991
You don't understand. If we go back,
they'll swamp the boat!

2019
02:41:05,032 --> 02:41:09,310
- They'll pull us right down!
- Knock it off. You're scaring me.

2020
02:41:09,352 --> 02:41:11,582
Come on, girls, grab an oar.

2021
02:41:11,632 --> 02:41:15,341
Are you mad?! We're in the middle
of the North Atlantic!

2022
02:41:15,392 --> 02:41:19,101
Do you people want to live
or do you want to die!

2023
02:41:25,192 --> 02:41:27,786
I don't understand a one of you.

2024
02:41:28,992 --> 02:41:31,301
What's the matter with you?!

2025
02:41:31,352 --> 02:41:33,741
It's your men out there!

2026
02:41:33,792 --> 02:41:38,547
- There's plenty of room for more.
- There'll be one less on this boat...

2027
02:41:38,592 --> 02:41:42,107
..if you don't shut that hole
in your face!

2028
02:41:42,192 --> 02:41:45,548
Woman in distance: Come back!

2029
02:41:55,392 --> 02:41:56,984
Take this one.

2030
02:41:57,032 --> 02:42:01,822
Bring in your oars over there.
Tie these two boats together as well.

2031
02:42:05,112 --> 02:42:08,582
Now make sure that's tied up
nice and tight.

2032
02:42:10,952 --> 02:42:13,830
Listen to me, men,
we have to go back.

2033
02:42:13,872 --> 02:42:18,900
I want to transfer all the women
from this boat into that boat.

2034
02:42:18,952 --> 02:42:21,307
Let's get some space there.

2035
02:42:22,712 --> 02:42:25,101
(Distant moaning)

2036
02:42:28,032 --> 02:42:30,262
(Shivering)

2037
02:42:30,312 --> 02:42:32,872
It's getting quiet.

2038
02:42:34,032 --> 02:42:37,786
It's just gonna take 'em
a couple of minutes to get...

2039
02:42:37,832 --> 02:42:40,187
..the boats organised.

2040
02:42:42,392 --> 02:42:44,826
I don't know about you, but...

2041
02:42:44,872 --> 02:42:49,866
..I intend to write a strongly worded letter
to the White Star Line...

2042
02:42:49,912 --> 02:42:51,903
..about all this.

2043
02:42:52,552 --> 02:42:55,544
(Distant moans and cries for help)

2044
02:42:57,592 --> 02:42:59,787
I love you, Jack.

2045
02:43:05,792 --> 02:43:07,783
Don't you do that.

2046
02:43:08,792 --> 02:43:11,864
Don't you say your goodbyes. Not yet.

2047
02:43:11,952 --> 02:43:13,908
Do you understand me?

2048
02:43:14,112 --> 02:43:16,103
I'm so cold.

2049
02:43:16,152 --> 02:43:18,029
Listen, Rose...

2050
02:43:18,072 --> 02:43:20,791
You're gonna get out of here.

2051
02:43:20,832 --> 02:43:25,906
You're gonna go on, and you're
gonna make lots of babies,...

2052
02:43:25,952 --> 02:43:29,183
..and you're gonna watch 'em grow.

2053
02:43:29,232 --> 02:43:31,223
You're gonna die an old...

2054
02:43:31,272 --> 02:43:34,469
..an old lady warm in her bed.

2055
02:43:35,152 --> 02:43:37,143
Not here.

2056
02:43:37,192 --> 02:43:40,548
Not this night. Not like this.

2057
02:43:40,592 --> 02:43:42,822
Do you understand me?

2058
02:43:45,232 --> 02:43:47,348
I can't feel my body.

2059
02:43:48,592 --> 02:43:54,030
Winning that ticket was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

2060
02:43:54,392 --> 02:43:56,383
It brought me to you...

2061
02:43:57,392 --> 02:44:00,145
..and I'm thankful for that, Rose.

2062
02:44:00,192 --> 02:44:02,183
I'm thankful.

2063
02:44:03,392 --> 02:44:06,065
You must... You must...

2064
02:44:07,592 --> 02:44:10,152
You must do me this honour...

2065
02:44:11,792 --> 02:44:15,546
You must promise me
that you'll survive,...

2066
02:44:17,512 --> 02:44:19,946
..that you won't give up,...

2067
02:44:19,992 --> 02:44:22,301
..no matter what happens,...

2068
02:44:24,592 --> 02:44:26,981
..no matter how hopeless.

2069
02:44:30,072 --> 02:44:32,063
Promise me now, Rose,...

2070
02:44:33,992 --> 02:44:36,790
..and never let go of that promise.

2071
02:44:37,632 --> 02:44:39,623
I promise.

2072
02:44:41,232 --> 02:44:43,223
Never let go.

2073
02:44:45,592 --> 02:44:47,787
I will never let go, Jack.

2074
02:44:50,192 --> 02:44:52,911
I'll never let go.

2075
02:45:14,392 --> 02:45:16,622
<font color="

2076
02:45:19,352 --> 02:45:21,343
Lowe: Oars!

2077
02:45:21,392 --> 02:45:23,622
Do you see any moving?

2078
02:45:23,672 --> 02:45:25,867
No, sir. None moving, sir.

2079
02:45:25,912 --> 02:45:27,903
Check them.

2080
02:45:28,472 --> 02:45:30,463
Bring that oar up here.

2081
02:45:34,472 --> 02:45:36,463
Check them. Make sure.

2082
02:45:37,992 --> 02:45:39,983
These are dead, sir.

2083
02:45:40,032 --> 02:45:41,624
Now give way.

2084
02:45:41,672 --> 02:45:43,469
Ahead easy.

2085
02:45:48,872 --> 02:45:51,147
Careful with your oars.

2086
02:45:51,192 --> 02:45:53,183
Don't hit them.

2087
02:45:54,552 --> 02:45:57,430
Is there anyone alive out there!

2088
02:45:57,952 --> 02:46:00,944
Can anyone hear me?

2089
02:46:01,952 --> 02:46:04,785
Is there anyone alive out there!

2090
02:46:10,712 --> 02:46:12,703
We waited too long.

2091
02:46:16,112 --> 02:46:19,468
We'll, keep checking them!
Keep looking!

2092
02:46:19,512 --> 02:46:22,390
Is there anyone alive out there!

2093
02:46:25,872 --> 02:46:27,988
Can anyone hear me!

2094
02:46:38,272 --> 02:46:42,868
(Rose singing softly)

2095
02:46:47,352 --> 02:46:50,628
♫  And it's up she goes.  ♫

2096
02:46:50,672 --> 02:46:52,947
♫  Up she goes.  ♫

(Lowe's voice, garbled and slow)

2099
02:47:28,992 --> 02:47:30,550
Jack?

2100
02:47:34,472 --> 02:47:36,428
Jack.

2101
02:47:38,952 --> 02:47:41,182
Jack.

2102
02:47:47,432 --> 02:47:50,344
Jack... there's a boat.

2103
02:47:51,112 --> 02:47:52,909
Jack...

2104
02:48:03,032 --> 02:48:04,750
Jack?

2105
02:48:05,152 --> 02:48:07,029
Jack...

2106
02:48:08,032 --> 02:48:10,023
Jack!

2107
02:48:12,632 --> 02:48:14,623
Jack!

2108
02:48:16,352 --> 02:48:18,991
There's a boat, Jack.

2109
02:48:21,072 --> 02:48:23,063
Jack?

2110
02:49:00,272 --> 02:49:02,263
Come back.

2111
02:49:02,552 --> 02:49:04,224
Come back!

2112
02:49:04,272 --> 02:49:06,103
(Voices of searchers)

2113
02:49:06,152 --> 02:49:08,143
Come back!

2114
02:49:08,632 --> 02:49:10,190
Come back!

2115
02:49:10,232 --> 02:49:12,223
Come back!

2116
02:49:13,112 --> 02:49:15,421
Come back! Come back!

2117
02:49:16,672 --> 02:49:18,503
Hello!

2118
02:49:19,832 --> 02:49:22,392
Can anyone hear me!

2119
02:49:22,472 --> 02:49:24,940
There's nothing here, sir.

2120
02:49:26,432 --> 02:49:28,423
Come back!

2121
02:49:29,152 --> 02:49:31,143
Come back...

2122
02:49:37,552 --> 02:49:39,543
I'll never let go.

2123
02:49:39,592 --> 02:49:41,583
I promise.

2124
02:50:18,792 --> 02:50:21,101
(Whistling)

2125
02:50:21,912 --> 02:50:23,903
Come about!

2126
02:50:44,552 --> 02:50:51,185
1,500 people went into the sea
when Titanic sank from under us.

2127
02:50:53,032 --> 02:50:56,820
There were 20 boats
floating nearby...

2128
02:50:57,272 --> 02:50:59,740
..and only one came back.

2129
02:51:00,552 --> 02:51:02,304
One.

2130
02:51:03,952 --> 02:51:06,750
Six were saved from the water,...

2131
02:51:06,792 --> 02:51:08,908
..myself included.

2132
02:51:09,632 --> 02:51:14,467
Six... out of 1,500.

2133
02:51:17,032 --> 02:51:19,023
Afterward,..

2134
02:51:19,552 --> 02:51:24,262
..the 700 people in the boats
had nothing to do but wait.

2135
02:51:25,952 --> 02:51:29,342
Wait to die, wait to live...

2136
02:51:30,352 --> 02:51:32,547
Wait for an absolution...

2137
02:51:32,592 --> 02:51:34,583
..that would never come.

2138
02:52:34,552 --> 02:52:38,830
Sir, I don't think you'll find
any of your people down here.

2139
02:52:38,872 --> 02:52:40,863
It's all steerage.

2140
02:52:42,112 --> 02:52:46,708
Woman: His hair is reddish brown.
Reddish brown and a white beard.

2141
02:52:46,752 --> 02:52:50,711
- Is there another passenger list?
- There's no other list.

2142
02:52:50,752 --> 02:52:55,030
- Perhaps he's on another ship.
- We're doing all we can, ma'am.

2143
02:53:16,552 --> 02:53:19,350
Rose: <i>That's the last time</i>
<i>I ever saw him.</i>

2144
02:53:19,392 --> 02:53:23,305
<i>He married, of course,</i>
<i>and inherited his millions.</i>

2145
02:53:23,352 --> 02:53:26,708
<i>But the crash of '29</i>
<i>hit his interests hard...</i>

2146
02:53:26,752 --> 02:53:29,949
<i>..and he put a pistol</i>
<i>in his mouth that year.</i>

2147
02:53:29,992 --> 02:53:32,711
Or so I read.

2148
02:53:43,592 --> 02:53:45,901
Can I take your name, please, love?

2149
02:53:48,952 --> 02:53:50,943
Dawson.

2150
02:53:52,192 --> 02:53:54,228
Rose Dawson.

2151
02:53:54,272 --> 02:53:56,263
Thank you.

2152
02:54:02,192 --> 02:54:06,743
We never found anything on Jack.
There's no record of him at all.

2153
02:54:06,792 --> 02:54:09,590
No, there wouldn't be, would there?

2154
02:54:09,912 --> 02:54:13,188
And I've never spoken of him until now.

2155
02:54:13,232 --> 02:54:15,223
Not to anyone.

2156
02:54:15,272 --> 02:54:17,786
Not even your grandfather.

2157
02:54:17,832 --> 02:54:21,427
A woman's heart
is a deep ocean of secrets.

2158
02:54:21,912 --> 02:54:25,985
But now you know there was
a man named Jack Dawson...

2159
02:54:26,032 --> 02:54:28,068
..and that he saved me.

2160
02:54:28,112 --> 02:54:31,661
In every way that a person can be saved.

2161
02:54:33,352 --> 02:54:35,991
I don't even have a picture of him.

2162
02:54:38,392 --> 02:54:41,987
He exists now only in my memory.

2163
02:54:46,512 --> 02:54:50,710
Man: Keldysh, Keldysh,
Mir 2 on our way to the surface.

2164
02:55:05,232 --> 02:55:08,588
Brock: I was saving this
for when I found the diamond.

2165
02:55:17,512 --> 02:55:19,503
I'm sorry.

2166
02:55:21,752 --> 02:55:26,143
Three years I've thought
of nothing except Titanic...

2167
02:55:27,072 --> 02:55:29,063
..but I never got it.

2168
02:55:31,712 --> 02:55:34,021
I never let it in.
