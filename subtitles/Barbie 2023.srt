1
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,560
<i>Since the beginning of time...</i>

2
00:01:35,883 --> 00:01:38,807
<i>Since the first little
girl ever existed</i>

3
00:01:39,753 --> 00:01:41,587
<i>There have been</i>

4
00:01:41,744 --> 00:01:43,744
<i>Dolls</i>

5
00:01:45,351 --> 00:01:47,870
<i>But dolls were always and forever</i>

6
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,333
<i>Baby dolls</i>

7
00:01:51,426 --> 00:01:55,476
<i>The girls who played with them
could only every play at being mother</i>

8
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:57,675
<i>Which can be fun...</i>

9
00:01:58,607 --> 00:02:00,720
<i>At least for a while anyway</i>

10
00:02:02,007 --> 00:02:03,707
<i>Ask your mother</i>

11
00:02:06,038 --> 00:02:08,001
<i>This continued until</i>

12
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,889
<i>Yes, Barbie changed everything</i>

13
00:03:18,736 --> 00:03:21,177
<i>Then she changed it all again</i>

14
00:03:21,716 --> 00:03:23,469
<i>All of these women are Barbie</i>

15
00:03:23,762 --> 00:03:26,661
<i>and Barbie is all of these women</i>

16
00:03:27,476 --> 00:03:30,702
<i>She might have started out
as just a lady in a bathing suit,</i>

17
00:03:30,822 --> 00:03:33,196
<i>but she became so much more</i>

18
00:03:33,845 --> 00:03:36,234
<i>She has her own money, her own house,</i>

19
00:03:36,354 --> 00:03:39,088
<i>her own car, her own career</i>

20
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:44,569
<i>Because Barbie can be
anything, women can be anything</i>

21
00:03:45,065 --> 00:03:47,282
<i>And this has been reflected back</i>

22
00:03:47,402 --> 00:03:50,784
<i>onto the little girls of
today in the real world</i>

23
00:03:51,507 --> 00:03:53,259
<i>Girls can grow into women</i>

24
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:57,193
<i>who can achieve everything
and anything they set their mind to</i>

25
00:03:57,734 --> 00:03:59,086
<i>Thanks to Barbie</i>

26
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:02,281
<i>all problems of feminism and equal rights</i>

27
00:04:02,717 --> 00:04:04,362
<i>have been solved</i>

28
00:04:05,706 --> 00:04:08,370
<i>At least that's what the Barbies think</i>

29
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,204
<i>After all, they're living in Barbie Land</i>

30
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,811
<i>Who am I to burst their bubble?</i>

31
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:17,277
<i>And here is one of those Barbies now</i>

32
00:04:17,397 --> 00:04:20,220
<i>Living her best day every day</i>

33
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,030
<i>When you're playing with Barbies</i>

34
00:06:20,182 --> 00:06:24,037
<i>Nobody bothers to walk them
down the stairs and out the door etc.</i>

35
00:06:24,724 --> 00:06:27,581
<i>You just pick them up and put
them where you want them to go</i>

36
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,501
<i>You use your imagination.</i>

37
00:06:36,788 --> 00:06:38,367
- Hi, Skipper!
- Hi, Barbie!

38
00:06:38,368 --> 00:06:38,980
Hi, Midge!

39
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,272
<i>Midge was Barbie's
pregnant friend.</i>

40
00:06:41,852 --> 00:06:45,029
<i>Well let's not show Midge actually
She was discontinued by Mattel</i>

41
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:47,620
<i>because a pregnant
doll is just too weird.</i>

42
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,440
<i>Anyway, Barbie has
another big day ahead of her.</i>

43
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,731
Hi, Barbie!

44
00:06:54,204 --> 00:06:55,804
- Hi, Barbie!
- Morning, Barbie!

45
00:06:56,126 --> 00:06:57,626
Hi!

46
00:06:57,726 --> 00:06:59,726
- Have another great day!
- Good morning Barbie!

47
00:06:59,727 --> 00:07:01,426
Hi!

48
00:07:01,451 --> 00:07:03,051
Hey, ladies!

49
00:07:05,937 --> 00:07:07,684
Everybody, turn to
the Barbie next to you.

50
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,756
Tell her how much you
love her, compliment her.

51
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:11,963
Reporter Barbie, you can
ask me any question you want.

52
00:07:11,987 --> 00:07:13,486
How come you're so amazing?

53
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,700
No comment.

54
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:18,262
No seriously, no comment.

55
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,391
I love you guys.

56
00:07:21,511 --> 00:07:23,516
The Nobel Prize for Journalism

57
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:25,491
goes to Barbie!

58
00:07:25,907 --> 00:07:28,255
I work very hard so
I deserve it.

59
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,311
And the Nobel Prize for
Literature goes to Barbie.

60
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:34,339
- You are the voice of a generation.
- I know.

61
00:07:34,602 --> 00:07:36,645
In our assessment,
money is not speech and

62
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:39,413
corporations have no free
speech rights to begin with

63
00:07:39,533 --> 00:07:41,954
So any claim on their part
to be exercising their right

64
00:07:42,074 --> 00:07:45,641
is just their attempt to turn
our democracy into a plutocracy

65
00:07:46,712 --> 00:07:48,893
This makes me emotional
and I'm expressing it

66
00:07:49,313 --> 00:07:54,230
I have no difficulty holding both
logic and feeling at the same time

67
00:07:54,288 --> 00:07:56,536
And it does not diminish my powers

68
00:07:56,881 --> 00:07:58,131
It expands them

69
00:08:07,165 --> 00:08:08,200
Hi Barbie!

70
00:08:09,012 --> 00:08:11,162
<i>What can't Barbie do?</i>

71
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:13,139
- Hi, Barbie!
- Hi, Barbie!

72
00:08:13,988 --> 00:08:15,210
Yay space!

73
00:08:16,948 --> 00:08:18,048
Gosh

74
00:08:23,698 --> 00:08:26,098
<i>Barbie has a great
day every day</i>

75
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:30,026
<i>But Ken only has a great
day if Barbie looks at him.</i>

76
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,457
- Hi, Barbie!
- Hi, Ken!

77
00:08:39,777 --> 00:08:41,472
- Hi, Barbie!
- Hi, Barbie!

78
00:08:41,573 --> 00:08:42,587
Hi, Barbie!

79
00:08:42,612 --> 00:08:43,572
Hi, Ken!

80
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,573
Hi, Ken.

81
00:08:45,174 --> 00:08:45,973
Hi, Ken!

82
00:08:45,298 --> 00:08:46,453
- Hi, Ken!
- Hi, Ken!

83
00:08:46,454 --> 00:08:48,054
- I us both got ice creams
- Cool

84
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:50,180
- Hi, Barbie!
- Hi, Barbie!

85
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,790
- Hi, Barbie!
- Hi, Barbie!

86
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:52,285
Hi, Barbie!

87
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,181
- Hi, Barbie!
- Hi, Barbie!

88
00:08:54,182 --> 00:08:55,076
- Hi, Barbie!
- Hi, Ken!

89
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,109
- Hi, Barbie!
- Hi, Barbie!

90
00:08:57,229 --> 00:08:58,505
Hi, Barbie!

91
00:08:58,525 --> 00:09:01,613
- Hi, Barbies!
- Bye, Barbies!

92
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,178
Hi, Barbie!

93
00:09:03,202 --> 00:09:04,590
Oh hi, Alan!

94
00:09:04,701 --> 00:09:07,489
<i>There are no multiples
of Alan, he's just Alan</i>

95
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:08,507
Yeah I'm ... uh ....

96
00:09:08,963 --> 00:09:10,307
confused about that

97
00:09:10,991 --> 00:09:12,957
Hey Barbie, check me out

98
00:09:31,296 --> 00:09:32,296
Ken!

99
00:09:49,527 --> 00:09:51,079
- Ken?
- Oh hey, Barbie

100
00:09:51,099 --> 00:09:51,937
Hi

101
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:53,482
How much of that did you see?

102
00:09:53,874 --> 00:09:54,974
We saw the whole thing

103
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,636
Let's get you up
on your feet Ken

104
00:09:56,756 --> 00:09:58,876
- You're just so strong
- Use your legs

105
00:09:58,896 --> 00:10:00,975
- Are you ok?
- Yep

106
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,014
Looks like this beach was a
little too much beach for you, Ken

107
00:10:04,134 --> 00:10:07,316
If I wasn't severly injured I would
beach you off right now, Ken

108
00:10:07,336 --> 00:10:09,312
I'll beach off with
you any day, Ken

109
00:10:09,336 --> 00:10:10,786
Hold my ice cream, Ken

110
00:10:11,464 --> 00:10:12,964
Alright Ken, you're on

111
00:10:13,995 --> 00:10:14,923
Let's beach off

112
00:10:15,043 --> 00:10:17,507
Anyone who wants to beach
him off has to beach me off first

113
00:10:17,527 --> 00:10:19,782
I will beach both of
you off at the same time

114
00:10:19,902 --> 00:10:21,566
But you don't even know how
to beach yourself off, how are

115
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,504
- you going to beach both of
- Okay...

116
00:10:22,528 --> 00:10:23,354
us off that doesn't make sense

117
00:10:23,386 --> 00:10:25,213
- Kens?
- Why are you getting emotional?

118
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:28,133
- You're going to beach both of us off?
- No one's going to beach anyone off

119
00:10:29,148 --> 00:10:30,048
Okay?

120
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,300
Let's go

121
00:10:32,405 --> 00:10:33,556
Okay, okay

122
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,051
Let's go

123
00:10:46,676 --> 00:10:48,916
- Barbie, hold my hand
- You're okay

124
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,982
Stay with me, Barbie

125
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,243
Great, not even broken.
You'll be fine

126
00:10:55,565 --> 00:10:58,208
Shredding waves is much more
dangerous than people realize

127
00:10:58,232 --> 00:10:59,598
You're very brave, Ken

128
00:11:00,915 --> 00:11:02,539
- Thank you, Barbie
- Yeah

129
00:11:02,634 --> 00:11:04,222
You know surfer is not even my job

130
00:11:04,342 --> 00:11:06,321
- I know
- And it is not lifeguard

131
00:11:06,441 --> 00:11:08,144
Which is a common misconception

132
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,011
Very common

133
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:10,331
Yeah cus actually my job

134
00:11:11,624 --> 00:11:13,943
- It's just beach
- Right

135
00:11:14,063 --> 00:11:17,156
- And what a good job you do at beach
- You should heal up in no time

136
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,742
Actually, in the time that it
took for me to say that sentence

137
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:20,477
 you healed

138
00:11:20,497 --> 00:11:22,022
- Fantastic
- Nice!

139
00:11:22,142 --> 00:11:23,188
- Hey Barbie
- Yeah?

140
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,242
- Can I come to your house tonight?
- Sure!

141
00:11:25,362 --> 00:11:27,532
I don't have anything big
planned, just a giant blow out party

142
00:11:27,652 --> 00:11:30,096
with all the Barbies and planned
choreography and a bespoke song

143
00:11:30,216 --> 00:11:31,366
You should stop by

144
00:11:31,807 --> 00:11:33,814
- So, cool?
- Yeah. Okay

145
00:11:33,849 --> 00:11:35,149
- Bye!
- Ok, bye. Goodbye

146
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:45,449
- Hi, Barbie
- Hi, Ken

147
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,729
- Looking good, Barbie!
- Thanks, Ken!

148
00:13:08,477 --> 00:13:10,127
- Oh hi, Ken!
- Hi

149
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:12,819
- Hi, Barbie!
- Hi, Barbie!

150
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,519
Barbie!

151
00:13:14,644 --> 00:13:15,794
What's up, Ken?

152
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,575
 Hey Barbie, check me out

153
00:13:34,505 --> 00:13:36,405
Bet you can't do
a flip like that, Ken

154
00:13:37,993 --> 00:13:38,793
What?

155
00:13:39,263 --> 00:13:41,563
- This is a real rager, Barbie.
- Thanks, Barbie!

156
00:13:41,564 --> 00:13:42,135
Gosh

157
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,746
This night is just perfect!

158
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,296
It's perfectly perfect

159
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,660
And you look so beautiful, Barbie

160
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,346
- Thanks, Barbie. I feel so beautiful
- So do I

161
00:13:50,366 --> 00:13:52,875
- This is the best day ever
- It is the best day ever

162
00:13:52,995 --> 00:13:54,967
And so was yesterday
and so is tomorrow

163
00:13:54,987 --> 00:13:57,076
and so was the day after
tomorrow and even Wednesdays

164
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,989
every day from
now until forever!

165
00:14:01,247 --> 00:14:03,247
Do you guys ever
think about dying?

166
00:14:13,381 --> 00:14:15,031
I don't know why I just...

167
00:14:16,713 --> 00:14:19,050
I'm just dying to dance!

168
00:14:59,396 --> 00:15:00,760
You can go now

169
00:15:01,436 --> 00:15:03,900
- I thought I might stay over tonight
- Why?

170
00:15:04,485 --> 00:15:06,985
- Because we're girlfriend boyfriend
- To do what?

171
00:15:08,732 --> 00:15:09,958
I'm actually not sure

172
00:15:10,897 --> 00:15:12,938
Oh, but, I don't want you here

173
00:15:13,614 --> 00:15:15,941
- Is it Ken?
- Ken's just a really good friend

174
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:18,406
And this is my Dream House,
it's Barbie's Dream House

175
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,682
It's not Ken's Dream House, right?

176
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:24,207
- Right as always
- And it's girl's night

177
00:15:24,327 --> 00:15:26,178
Come on, Barbie!  Slumber Party!

178
00:15:26,298 --> 00:15:29,041
- Hurry up, the President's here
- I am! You're welcome

179
00:15:29,926 --> 00:15:33,024
- Every night is girl's night?
- Mmhm. Every night.  Forever.

180
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:36,609
- Every night
- Forever and ever

181
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:38,631
- Good night
- Good night

182
00:15:44,794 --> 00:15:46,309
I love you too

183
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,846
Girl's night! Girls night! Girls night!

184
00:15:49,371 --> 00:15:51,171
I can't. I gotta go

185
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:54,201
Girl's night! Girls night! Girls night!

186
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:02,726
Good night, Barbies! I'm definitely
not thinking about death anymore

187
00:16:30,042 --> 00:16:31,283
Hi, Barbie!

188
00:16:36,943 --> 00:16:38,344
Hi, Barbie!

189
00:16:40,574 --> 00:16:41,763
Hi, Barbie!

190
00:17:25,493 --> 00:17:26,993
<i>Ooh, girl you okay?</i>

191
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,480
Hi, Barbie!

192
00:17:29,491 --> 00:17:31,587
I'm fine.  A-okay!

193
00:17:32,607 --> 00:17:35,710
- You got it, Barbie!
- Let's go, Barbie!

194
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:37,099
Great cheer, Kens

195
00:17:39,821 --> 00:17:41,773
Come on, Barbie, let's
run towards the water

196
00:17:42,017 --> 00:17:42,917
Okay

197
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,850
My feet!

198
00:17:58,810 --> 00:17:59,610
Oh no

199
00:18:07,685 --> 00:18:09,635
- Hey, Barbie!
- Are you okay?

200
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,362
- Yeah, Barbie, I just fell
- Fell?

201
00:18:12,363 --> 00:18:13,157
I'm so embarrassed

202
00:18:13,182 --> 00:18:14,534
Barbie doesn't get embarrassed

203
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:17,046
I know.  Barbie, I... I don't
even have context for this

204
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:19,633
but my feet, my heels

205
00:18:19,753 --> 00:18:20,887
are on the ground

206
00:18:21,007 --> 00:18:24,034
- I'm no longer on tiptoes
- That's okay. Let me see

207
00:18:27,699 --> 00:18:30,199
Flatfeet!

208
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:40,503
Stop it, Ken

209
00:18:40,682 --> 00:18:42,069
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

210
00:18:42,448 --> 00:18:45,059
I know I'm stereotypical
Barbie and therefore don't form

211
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,684
conjectures concerning the
causality of adjacent unfolding events

212
00:18:47,704 --> 00:18:50,507
but some things are
happening that might be related

213
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:55,813
Bad breath this morning, a cold shower,
burnt waffle, and falling off my roof

214
00:18:55,933 --> 00:18:58,780
- You're malfunctioning
- What?  No!  I'm just, I'm...

215
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,753
- Am I?
- I've never seen this kind of malfunction before

216
00:19:01,873 --> 00:19:03,550
It's usually just hair related

217
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,603
You know, you're going to
have to visit Weird Barbie

218
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:11,384
- I have never had to visit Weird Barbie
- That's because you've never malfunctioned

219
00:19:11,472 --> 00:19:14,546
I heard she that she used to
be the most beautiful Barbie of all

220
00:19:14,547 --> 00:19:17,919
but then somebody played with
her too hard in The Real World

221
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:32,071
And now she's fated to an eternity
of making other Barbies perfect

222
00:19:32,191 --> 00:19:34,791
while falling more and
more into disrepair herself

223
00:19:35,303 --> 00:19:38,800
That and we all call her Weird Barbie
both behind her back and also to her face

224
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,420
She's so weird

225
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:43,869
Why is she always in the splits?

226
00:19:51,855 --> 00:19:55,155
I would never wear heels if
my feet were shaped this way

227
00:19:59,126 --> 00:20:00,076
Hello

228
00:20:00,724 --> 00:20:02,724
<i>Woof</i>

229
00:20:02,749 --> 00:20:03,549
<i>Bark</i>

230
00:20:05,393 --> 00:20:07,393
<i>Woof</i>

231
00:20:07,418 --> 00:20:08,368
<i>Bark</i>

232
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:09,989
Hey

233
00:20:11,414 --> 00:20:12,978
What's cookin' good lookin'?

234
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,620
- Hi
- Welcome

235
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,449
Welcome to my Weird House

236
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,695
- Hi, how are ya?
- Nice to met you

237
00:20:22,715 --> 00:20:25,030
Sorry for the dog crap.
What can I do ya for?

238
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,884
I just had to come
see you about my feet

239
00:20:28,336 --> 00:20:29,236
They're um...

240
00:20:36,055 --> 00:20:36,955
Flat!

241
00:20:37,525 --> 00:20:38,325
Yeah

242
00:20:38,596 --> 00:20:40,411
- Never seen that before
- Really?

243
00:20:41,588 --> 00:20:43,083
Okay, well can you...

244
00:20:43,203 --> 00:20:44,423
you know, fix them?

245
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,593
- You're stereotypical Barbie, right?
- Mmhmm

246
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:49,031
That Ken of yours

247
00:20:49,151 --> 00:20:53,033
- He is one nice lookin' little protein pot
- I guess

248
00:20:53,153 --> 00:20:56,250
I'd like to see what kind of nude
blob he's packing under those jeans

249
00:20:57,512 --> 00:20:59,977
- Anyway, what preceeded this?
- Oh, nothing

250
00:21:00,364 --> 00:21:02,857
A really fun game of volleyball

251
00:21:03,856 --> 00:21:06,256
- That's it?
- Thoughts of death...

252
00:21:06,817 --> 00:21:07,767
What is...

253
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:11,103
Maybe some

254
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,651
- Thoughts of death?
- Thoughts of death?!

255
00:21:14,216 --> 00:21:16,066
- Is that a problem?
- Ohhh

256
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,819
- What?
- I've heard this

257
00:21:17,939 --> 00:21:19,986
Of course I didn't
think it was possible

258
00:21:20,044 --> 00:21:21,444
But it's real

259
00:21:22,969 --> 00:21:25,253
Oh, you've done it.
You've opened a portal

260
00:21:25,473 --> 00:21:28,428
- I didn't open a portal
- Someone did

261
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,993
And now there is a rift

262
00:21:29,994 --> 00:21:33,893
in the continuum that is the membrane
between Barbie Land and the Real World

263
00:21:34,013 --> 00:21:36,374
and if you want to be
stereotypical Barbie perfect again

264
00:21:36,398 --> 00:21:38,189
then baby girl,
you've gotta go fix it

265
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,799
Or you're going to keep going funny.
Look at your upper thigh

266
00:21:42,752 --> 00:21:44,520
- What is that?
- That's cellulite

267
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,127
- That's going to spread everywhere
- What?

268
00:21:46,147 --> 00:21:49,030
And then you're going to start
getting sad and mushy and complicated

269
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,050
No!

270
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:51,796
What do I have to do?

271
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,991
You have to go to the Real World

272
00:21:55,288 --> 00:21:57,830
And you will find the
girl who's playing with you

273
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,837
- Playing with me?
- We're all getting played with, babe

274
00:21:59,838 --> 00:22:02,260
But usually there's some
kind of separation.  Thanks

275
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,392
There's the girl and the doll

276
00:22:04,512 --> 00:22:06,355
and never the twains shall cross

277
00:22:06,475 --> 00:22:07,765
- The twain is crossing?
- Yes

278
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:09,032
And the girl who's playing with you

279
00:22:09,052 --> 00:22:12,444
she must be sad and her thoughts
and feelings and humanness

280
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:14,559
are interferring with your dollness

281
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:16,279
Why would she be sad?

282
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:20,568
We fixed everything so that all women in
the real world can be happy and powerful

283
00:22:20,588 --> 00:22:23,407
I don't know, but if you ask me
you had something to do with this too

284
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:24,921
- Me?
- It takes two rift a portal

285
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:29,193
I can't have. I've only every wanted for
everything to stay exactly as it is

286
00:22:29,313 --> 00:22:33,693
Well be that as it may, the two of you
are becoming inextricably intertwined

287
00:22:34,107 --> 00:22:36,657
And you gotta help
her to help yourself

288
00:22:42,188 --> 00:22:42,881
So should...

289
00:22:43,601 --> 00:22:45,110
So what'll it be then?

290
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,078
You can go back to your regular life
and forget any of this ever happened

291
00:22:48,198 --> 00:22:50,841
Or you can know the
truth about the universe

292
00:22:52,285 --> 00:22:54,522
The choice is now yours

293
00:22:55,518 --> 00:22:57,068
The first one. The high heel

294
00:22:57,337 --> 00:22:58,137
No.

295
00:22:58,457 --> 00:22:59,457
We'll do a redo

296
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:01,851
You're supposed
to want to know

297
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:02,713
I don't

298
00:23:02,836 --> 00:23:06,125
Babe? Listen? You have to
want to know, okay?  Do it again

299
00:23:06,145 --> 00:23:08,472
I'm not Adventure Barbie,
I'm Stereotypical Barbie

300
00:23:08,492 --> 00:23:11,710
I'm like the Barbie you think of when
someone says, "Think of a Barbie"

301
00:23:12,255 --> 00:23:13,132
That's me

302
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,903
I'm bummed. You're a bummer

303
00:23:16,214 --> 00:23:17,793
- That's a bummer
- Okay

304
00:23:17,913 --> 00:23:21,390
- I'm ready to forget now
- No, you're do-ing-this-one

305
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:24,565
I just gave you choice so you
could feel some sense of control

306
00:23:24,585 --> 00:23:26,214
So there is no option 1?

307
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,467
No, <i>you</i> have to
fix the rift yourself

308
00:23:29,687 --> 00:23:32,054
Don't blame me, blame
Mattel. They make the rules

309
00:23:32,274 --> 00:23:35,333
- I don't want too!
- Fine, get cellulite. I don't care

310
00:23:35,353 --> 00:23:37,375
No, no no no, no. Okay

311
00:23:40,513 --> 00:23:42,063
Send me through the portal

312
00:23:43,311 --> 00:23:45,947
Okay, there's actually no portal.
It's a figure of speech

313
00:23:46,067 --> 00:23:48,984
It's actually a sports
car to a speedboat...

314
00:23:49,104 --> 00:23:51,444
to a rocketship to a tandem bike...

315
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:53,754
to a camper van
finally to a snowmobile

316
00:23:54,192 --> 00:23:57,020
Which will take you most of the
way to the state of Los Angeles

317
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,277
where you will don
neon and rollerblades

318
00:23:59,301 --> 00:24:01,437
and then through the
country of California

319
00:24:01,917 --> 00:24:04,186
Weird, I know. Best if you
don't think about it too much

320
00:24:04,206 --> 00:24:07,029
And then when I get
there, how do I find this girl?

321
00:24:07,671 --> 00:24:08,939
You will know

322
00:24:09,595 --> 00:24:10,595
Okay

323
00:24:11,058 --> 00:24:13,918
- And how do I get back?
- The same way you came, but in reverse

324
00:24:13,938 --> 00:24:16,659
Like I should move forward,
but through the order backward...

325
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:18,652
- Don't overthink it
- Oh, okay

326
00:24:18,672 --> 00:24:20,022
For you see...

327
00:24:20,371 --> 00:24:22,936
If you don't find
her and fix things,

328
00:24:23,056 --> 00:24:26,766
what's ugly will become uglier,
and what's weird will become weirder

329
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,730
And then you'll look like me

330
00:24:31,143 --> 00:24:32,143
Sorry.

331
00:24:32,742 --> 00:24:33,842
I understand.

332
00:24:33,962 --> 00:24:36,570
I set myself up for that.
Anyway, I believe in you

333
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:38,991
- Thank you
- Go. Be careful

334
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,200
I love you

335
00:24:40,434 --> 00:24:42,238
- Bye
- Bye

336
00:24:42,358 --> 00:24:44,370
Bon voyage to reality

337
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,257
and good luck
restoring the membrane

338
00:24:47,377 --> 00:24:50,076
that separates our world from theirs

339
00:24:50,196 --> 00:24:52,367
so you don't get cellulite!

340
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,569
- I guess she's going without you
- You're so lost, Ken

341
00:24:57,609 --> 00:24:59,359
She literally asked me

342
00:24:59,382 --> 00:25:02,144
- And I was like, "I prefer to stay here"
- Why?

343
00:25:02,264 --> 00:25:04,014
- Are you scared?
- No.

344
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:07,140
I bet you're scared and I bet
she doesn't even want you to go

345
00:25:07,853 --> 00:25:11,253
Well you bet both those things incorrectly,
and I bet in the opposite direction

346
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:12,609
- Yeah?
- Yeah

347
00:25:12,729 --> 00:25:13,979
Which way is that?

348
00:25:14,677 --> 00:25:15,913
You don't even know

349
00:25:16,033 --> 00:25:19,299
I just don't want to leave.
I'm trying to find reasons not to leave

350
00:25:19,334 --> 00:25:21,549
- Please stay
- I'm going to miss you guys so much

351
00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:23,389
I just wish someone
could come with me

352
00:25:23,413 --> 00:25:25,032
But you can't. I
should do this alone.

353
00:25:25,052 --> 00:25:26,274
What bird am I thinking of?

354
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:28,594
-Parrot
-Dolphin.  I mean, no, a bird

355
00:25:29,406 --> 00:25:30,356
Pelican

356
00:25:31,143 --> 00:25:31,943
Man

357
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:33,115
We'll miss you, Barbie

358
00:25:33,139 --> 00:25:34,892
I'll be back in no
time with perfect feet

359
00:25:34,912 --> 00:25:36,654
and we'll forget that
this ever happened

360
00:25:36,674 --> 00:25:39,148
And you'll get to see all the good
work we've done to fix the world

361
00:25:39,168 --> 00:25:41,022
You'll be such a hero to them

362
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:45,409
All those grateful powerful women
who owe their wonderful lives to Barbie

363
00:25:45,468 --> 00:25:48,878
I'll bet every woman will say thank
you and give you a really big hug

364
00:25:49,188 --> 00:25:50,748
Yes, you're right!

365
00:25:51,146 --> 00:25:52,246
Here I go!

366
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,520
Bye!

367
00:25:54,168 --> 00:25:56,283
- Bye, Barbie.
- Bye!

368
00:25:58,007 --> 00:26:00,591
Bye, Barbie.
Good luck in reality

369
00:26:00,711 --> 00:26:02,411
Watch out for cellulite!

370
00:26:02,807 --> 00:26:06,907
<i>I went to the doctor,
I went to the mountains</i>

371
00:26:07,242 --> 00:26:11,927
<i>I looked to the children,
I drank from the fountains</i>

372
00:26:12,168 --> 00:26:15,970
<i>There's more than one
answer to these questions</i>

373
00:26:16,357 --> 00:26:18,736
<i>Pointing me in a crooked line</i>

374
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:23,396
<i>And the less I seek my
source for some definitive</i>

375
00:26:23,684 --> 00:26:27,618
<i>Closer I am to fine</i>

376
00:26:28,451 --> 00:26:30,300
<i>- Closer I am to fi...
- Closer I am to fi...</i>

377
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:40,728
- What are you doing here?
- I'm coming with ya

378
00:26:40,748 --> 00:26:42,972
- No, please get out
- I can't

379
00:26:43,092 --> 00:26:45,330
I made a double bet with Ken, and...

380
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,479
you can't make me look
uncool in front of Ken

381
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:50,167
- Ken's not cool!
- He is to me

382
00:26:50,187 --> 00:26:52,184
You're just going
to slow me down

383
00:26:52,408 --> 00:26:54,105
What if there's beach?

384
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:56,083
You'll need someone
who's a professional in that

385
00:26:58,351 --> 00:26:59,951
Did you bring your rollerblades?

386
00:27:00,656 --> 00:27:02,506
I literally go nowhere without them

387
00:27:04,006 --> 00:27:05,106
Please?

388
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:06,457
Okay

389
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:08,857
Let's do this

390
00:27:09,441 --> 00:27:10,669
- Can I sit in the front?
- No

391
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:12,504
REAL WORLD this way

392
00:27:12,524 --> 00:27:15,806
<i>And so Barbie and Ken
set off on their adventure</i>

393
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:17,676
<i>to the Real World</i>

394
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:41,999
Hi

395
00:27:50,452 --> 00:27:51,352
Barbie!

396
00:28:03,067 --> 00:28:04,568
This is the Real World!

397
00:28:04,688 --> 00:28:07,094
Barbie, I told you
there would be beach

398
00:28:07,214 --> 00:28:08,014
Yeah

399
00:28:20,512 --> 00:28:23,012
- What's going on?
- Give us a smile, blondie

400
00:28:24,754 --> 00:28:27,556
- Why are these men looking at me?
- Yeah, they're also staring at me

401
00:28:28,174 --> 00:28:30,674
- Ooh, love that
- Wow

402
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:33,604
I feel kind of ill at ease, like

403
00:28:33,782 --> 00:28:36,052
I don't know the word for it, but I'm...

404
00:28:36,352 --> 00:28:38,002
conscious, but it's...

405
00:28:38,122 --> 00:28:40,145
myself that I'm conscious of

406
00:28:40,265 --> 00:28:44,114
I'm not getting any of that. I feel
what can only be described as "admire"

407
00:28:44,975 --> 00:28:46,218
But not ogle

408
00:28:47,091 --> 00:28:48,860
And there's no
undertone of violence

409
00:28:48,884 --> 00:28:51,314
Mine very much has
an undertone of violence

410
00:28:51,782 --> 00:28:53,334
Oh look, a construction site

411
00:28:53,704 --> 00:28:55,775
We need that good
feminine energy

412
00:28:56,417 --> 00:28:57,867
Ladies, yoohoo!

413
00:28:58,537 --> 00:28:59,677
Oh, you got fries
with that shake?

414
00:28:59,701 --> 00:29:01,887
If I said you had a hot body
would you hold it against me?

415
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,459
- You don't have a mirror in your pocket?
- Baby, you are an angel!

416
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,554
- I can see myself in your shorts

417
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:08,718
I don't know exactly what you
meant with all of those little quips

418
00:29:08,738 --> 00:29:12,333
But I'm picking up on some sort of
entendre which appears to be double

419
00:29:12,411 --> 00:29:16,434
and I would just like to inform
you: I do not have a vagina

420
00:29:17,574 --> 00:29:19,274
And he does not have a penis

421
00:29:19,574 --> 00:29:21,872
- We don't have genitals
- That's okay

422
00:29:24,621 --> 00:29:26,285
I have all... all the genitals

423
00:29:27,111 --> 00:29:29,252
Geez, you would think a
construction site at lunchtime

424
00:29:29,276 --> 00:29:31,617
would be the perfect place
for a little woman power

425
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:33,375
This one was so...

426
00:29:33,887 --> 00:29:34,887
male

427
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:37,201
Everything's almost like...

428
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,619
reversed here

429
00:29:42,389 --> 00:29:43,190
Oh look!

430
00:29:43,391 --> 00:29:46,141
- The Supreme Court
- They're so smart

431
00:29:53,462 --> 00:29:57,117
- I love me a leotard
- I love the elbow pads

432
00:29:57,173 --> 00:29:59,023
I... I think we should get
some different clothes

433
00:30:01,351 --> 00:30:02,601
We look great

434
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,696
- I love fringe
- I love denim

435
00:30:06,275 --> 00:30:07,275
Hey, man!

436
00:30:07,976 --> 00:30:09,626
You guys gotta pay for that stuff

437
00:30:12,763 --> 00:30:15,751
- She looks even better in more clothes
- Because you can imagine more

438
00:30:15,771 --> 00:30:17,505
Do you know what?  Keep 'em.

439
00:30:18,551 --> 00:30:23,133
Weird Barbie said I would know
how to find this girl, but I have no idea

440
00:30:23,937 --> 00:30:25,464
What would a Smart Barbie do?

441
00:30:25,488 --> 00:30:27,912
I just need to clear
my mind so I can think

442
00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:30,387
Who is playing with me?

443
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:32,421
I hate it when people
think. It gets so boring

444
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:34,843
The faster I figure it out,
the faster we get to go home

445
00:30:34,963 --> 00:30:38,060
- What am I supposed to do?
- Ken! Go for a walk or something

446
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,635
By myself?

447
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:40,070
- Yes
- Really? Where?

448
00:30:40,095 --> 00:30:41,108
Anywhere!

449
00:30:41,128 --> 00:30:43,313
- Can I go that way?
- Yes. Okay

450
00:30:48,868 --> 00:30:50,718
- Don't go far.
- Okay!

451
00:30:55,246 --> 00:30:56,543
Excuse me, sir

452
00:30:57,261 --> 00:30:58,581
Thanks, man

453
00:31:09,109 --> 00:31:10,309
What's up, man?

454
00:31:10,514 --> 00:31:12,459
- We gotta man up on this one
- Great workout, man

455
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,111
Men, men, men!

456
00:31:14,231 --> 00:31:16,363
- You're the man!
- No, you're the man

457
00:31:16,483 --> 00:31:18,562
Men, men, men!

458
00:31:28,476 --> 00:31:30,822
Based on earnings, we
exceeded expectations

459
00:31:31,743 --> 00:31:32,735
So I'm not worried about it

460
00:31:32,755 --> 00:31:34,511
Not now, Margaret.
Let's shake on this

461
00:31:34,631 --> 00:31:36,770
We're officially important

462
00:31:59,804 --> 00:32:00,804
Yes!

463
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:09,790
That felt...

464
00:33:10,998 --> 00:33:11,998
achy...

465
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:13,573
but good

466
00:34:08,023 --> 00:34:09,423
You're so beautiful

467
00:34:11,126 --> 00:34:12,126
I know it

468
00:34:19,428 --> 00:34:20,328
Barbie!

469
00:34:20,448 --> 00:34:21,348
Barbie!

470
00:34:21,672 --> 00:34:22,472
Yes!

471
00:34:22,908 --> 00:34:24,237
- I've got it!
- I've got it!

472
00:34:24,357 --> 00:34:26,045
- What do you got?
- You go first

473
00:34:26,165 --> 00:34:27,816
- We'll go at the same time
- Okay

474
00:34:27,976 --> 00:34:29,866
- She's at school!
- Men rule the world!

475
00:34:30,204 --> 00:34:31,932
- What was that?
- The kid's at the school?

476
00:34:31,952 --> 00:34:32,719
But what did you say?

477
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,039
- Nothing
- Okay

478
00:34:34,215 --> 00:34:36,080
- Well, let's go to the school!
- Okay!

479
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,000
Now come on

480
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,966
MATTEL HEADQUARTERS
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

481
00:34:55,268 --> 00:34:57,220
- Hello
- This is Dan with the FBI

482
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,844
This is Aaron at Mattel...

483
00:34:58,868 --> 00:35:00,485
I don't give a flying
squirrel who you are, Aaron

484
00:35:00,505 --> 00:35:02,380
- What are you? Like an intern?
- No...

485
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,638
- Two of your dolls have gotten loose
- Impossible.  How do you know...

486
00:35:05,758 --> 00:35:08,959
Don't sass me, Aaron. Couple of
blondes, answering to Barbie nd Ken

Mattel's help landing the eagle</i>

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,050
-<i>Don't crap the bed, Aaron</i>
- I won't

490
00:35:17,762 --> 00:35:19,612
This is bad.  This is really bad

491
00:35:19,832 --> 00:35:21,682
- What?
- Th...th... this happened before

492
00:35:22,013 --> 00:35:22,945
What? When?

493
00:35:23,065 --> 00:35:25,505
I heard about 10 years ago, a
woman named, Skipper

494
00:35:25,525 --> 00:35:29,332
turned up at some family's home in
Key West, asked to babysit the kids

495
00:35:29,352 --> 00:35:31,060
She then tried to take
their toddler surfing

496
00:35:31,061 --> 00:35:31,755
- Jeez
- I know

497
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:35,301
They where able to straighten it
out, keep it under wraps, but this is...

498
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:36,709
serious

499
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:38,721
- I'm going all the way up
- No one goes all the way up

500
00:35:38,841 --> 00:35:40,660
- I have to
- You may never come back

501
00:35:42,368 --> 00:35:43,268
I know

502
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:00,852
- Hey
- Oh hi, Aaron

503
00:36:00,972 --> 00:36:02,798
- New drawings?
- Yeah

504
00:36:02,818 --> 00:36:05,447
I just started drawing
these weird designs

505
00:36:05,467 --> 00:36:09,031
- These are different
- It's Irrepressible Thoughts of Death Barbie.

Okay, listen, I have to
speak to the top brass

509
00:36:16,992 --> 00:36:18,399
- No
- I must

510
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:19,372
- No.
- I'm going to

00:36:19,492 --> 00:36:22,619
Aron, they're in a big corporate
idea sesh, no one is to be admitted

512
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:25,559
... we empowering girls. Always!

513
00:36:25,866 --> 00:36:27,485
But what do we really sell?

514
00:36:27,605 --> 00:36:30,846
I'll tell you what. We sell
dreams. And imagination

515
00:36:32,344 --> 00:36:33,439
And sparkle

516
00:36:34,315 --> 00:36:35,692
I get excited, I'm passionate.

517
00:36:35,812 --> 00:36:38,816
And when you think of sparkle,
what do you think of after that?

We're in the middle of a major

00:36:47,785 --> 00:36:49,476
I think you're going
to want to hear this, sir

525
00:36:55,368 --> 00:36:58,229
May I put it in a whisper, sir?

526
00:36:58,687 --> 00:37:00,237
Fine, whisper me

527
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:23,690
No.

528
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,830
Pointed the chair.

529
00:37:27,957 --> 00:37:28,757
You're okay

530
00:37:30,334 --> 00:37:32,411
- You alright?
- He's okay

531
00:37:36,703 --> 00:37:38,453
It's a repeat of Skipper in Key West

532
00:37:38,573 --> 00:37:40,173
And with all due respect...

533
00:37:40,655 --> 00:37:43,443
That was Skipper,
sir. This is...

534
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:45,304
Barbie.

535
00:37:47,645 --> 00:37:51,355
If this got out that our dolls were
coming to Los Angeles from Barbie Land

536
00:37:51,475 --> 00:37:54,125
As life sized versions of themselves

537
00:37:54,988 --> 00:37:56,488
Roaming the earth

538
00:37:57,949 --> 00:37:59,649
This would be very bad

539
00:38:00,371 --> 00:38:02,462
Barbie in the real world?

540
00:38:03,647 --> 00:38:04,627
That's impossible

541
00:38:04,747 --> 00:38:07,392
We've got a definite situation on our hands

542
00:38:07,464 --> 00:38:09,033
Catastrophic!

543
00:38:09,645 --> 00:38:11,647
- I can't stress that enough!
- What?

544
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,345
- What's your name again?
- Aaron Dinkins, sir

545
00:38:14,465 --> 00:38:15,944
- Aaron Dickinson?
- Dinkins

546
00:38:15,964 --> 00:38:16,764
Yes, Aaron

547
00:38:16,784 --> 00:38:20,202
Is Barbie Land like an alternate
reality or is it like a place where

548
00:38:20,322 --> 00:38:22,684
- Uh, your imagination
-Yes.

549
00:38:23,076 --> 00:38:25,261
- Okay.
- Think of it as town in Sweden.

550
00:38:25,581 --> 00:38:26,881
Aaron Dinkins

551
00:38:27,232 --> 00:38:28,232
Sweden

552
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:29,474
Right

553
00:38:31,721 --> 00:38:33,005
How much do you weigh?

554
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:34,475
Doesn't matter

555
00:38:35,164 --> 00:38:36,615
Sounds like a job for the box

556
00:38:36,878 --> 00:38:41,220
No one rests until this
doll is back in a box

557
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:45,558
Look, Davy Crockett Junior High
School, just like a saw in my vision

558
00:38:45,582 --> 00:38:46,754
A man on a horse

559
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,758
I've started to get all
these weirdo feelings

560
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:51,537
Like I have fear with
no specific object

561
00:38:51,735 --> 00:38:53,374
- What is that?
- Anxiety

562
00:38:53,652 --> 00:38:55,989
I have it too. They're
just awful at this age

563
00:38:56,109 --> 00:38:57,861
I feel amazing.

564
00:38:57,885 --> 00:38:59,965
That's because kids don't
take it out on their dads

565
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:03,422
She's gotta be here somewhere.
We need to find her soon

566
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:06,877
I'm just going to pop into the library
and see if I can find any books on trucks

567
00:39:06,897 --> 00:39:09,474
- Okay, just don't get in trouble
- I won't!

568
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:25,012
What are you doing?

569
00:39:25,013 --> 00:39:26,754
Oh! Uhh

570
00:39:26,779 --> 00:39:28,229
What's that girl's name?

571
00:39:28,504 --> 00:39:29,504
That's Sasha

572
00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:30,704
Hey, Sasha!

573
00:39:30,728 --> 00:39:31,737
- Don't talk to her!
- Oh

574
00:39:31,757 --> 00:39:34,887
Sasha can talk to you
but you <i>never</i> talk to Sasha

575
00:39:34,907 --> 00:39:36,951
- She'll crush you
- Don't worry

576
00:39:37,071 --> 00:39:39,665
Everyone really likes me
and thinks I'm cool and pretty

577
00:39:40,453 --> 00:39:42,703
- Huh
- Thank you

578
00:39:45,345 --> 00:39:47,792
Hey, ladies. Sasha

579
00:39:47,912 --> 00:39:48,973
What's up?

580
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,200
Who are you?

581
00:39:55,462 --> 00:39:58,378
I'm only your favorite
woman of all time

582
00:39:58,966 --> 00:40:00,112
Barbie!

583
00:40:02,054 --> 00:40:04,482
You really think
you're Barbie?

584
00:40:04,706 --> 00:40:05,841
- Yeah
- She's crazy

585
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,262
Do you think she escaped
from like an insane asylum?

586
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:09,887
- So you're like Barbie Barbie
- Like a professional bimbo?

587
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:14,238
No, Barbie's not a bimbo. Barbie is a
doctor and a lawyer and a senator and a...

588
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:17,068
- ... Nobel prize winner.
- You're a Nobel prize winner?

589
00:40:17,088 --> 00:40:18,682
Oh, no, not me, but...

590
00:40:19,347 --> 00:40:21,537
Barbie is ... yeah

591
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:25,086
Aren't you guys going to
thank me and give me a big hug?

592
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:29,254
For being your favorite toy

593
00:40:29,474 --> 00:40:32,658
We haven't played with Barbie's
since we were like five years old

594
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,322
Yeah, I hated dolls with hair

595
00:40:34,346 --> 00:40:36,929
I mean, I played with Barbie,
but it was like the last resort

596
00:40:36,982 --> 00:40:38,282
I loved Barbie

597
00:40:39,987 --> 00:40:42,149
Anyways, even then
it was horrible for us

598
00:40:42,419 --> 00:40:43,619
It was horrible?

599
00:40:45,006 --> 00:40:46,006
Why?

600
00:40:46,255 --> 00:40:47,646
- Come on, Sasha
- Give it to her

601
00:40:47,647 --> 00:40:49,029
Destroy Barbie

602
00:40:50,054 --> 00:40:51,454
Okay, Barbie

603
00:40:52,042 --> 00:40:53,042
Let's do this

604
00:40:53,882 --> 00:40:57,218
You've been making women feel bad
about themselves since you were invented

605
00:40:57,238 --> 00:40:58,991
I think you have that
the wrong way around

606
00:40:59,015 --> 00:41:01,241
You represent everything
wrong with our culture

607
00:41:01,614 --> 00:41:04,667
Sexualized capitalism,
unrealistic physical ideals

608
00:41:04,787 --> 00:41:08,070
No, no, no...
You're describing something stereotypical.

609
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,514
Barbie is...

610
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:12,430
- So much more than that
- Look at yourself

611
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:16,437
I am technically
Stereotypical Barbie

612
00:41:16,461 --> 00:41:18,940
You set the feminism
movement back 50 years

613
00:41:19,112 --> 00:41:20,820
You destroy girls'
innate sense of worth

614
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,501
and you are killing the planet with
your glorification of rampant consumerism

615
00:41:24,597 --> 00:41:28,970
No, I'm supposed to help you
and make you happy and powerful

616
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:32,811
Oh, I am powerful.  And until you showed
up here and declared yourself Barbie

617
00:41:32,931 --> 00:41:35,370
I hadn't thought about
you in years, you fascist

618
00:41:39,795 --> 00:41:41,795
Oh. Um

619
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,220
Okay

620
00:41:43,624 --> 00:41:45,105
It's happening again

621
00:41:45,433 --> 00:41:47,822
I have to... will you excuse me?

622
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,404
It was really
nice talking to you

623
00:41:57,757 --> 00:41:59,307
They never listen

624
00:42:13,034 --> 00:42:14,784
Excuse me, sir, do you have time?

625
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,708
- You respect me
- Sorry, no, do you know what time it is?

626
00:42:19,884 --> 00:42:21,084
No, I do not

627
00:42:23,066 --> 00:42:25,238
- Okay
- Why didn't Barbie tell me about patriarchy?

628
00:42:25,758 --> 00:42:29,408
Which, to my understanding, is
where men in horses run everything?

629
00:42:29,849 --> 00:42:30,849
Sure

630
00:42:31,245 --> 00:42:33,680
- I shall seek my fortune then
- Alright

631
00:42:36,146 --> 00:42:38,629
I'll take a high level, high
paying job with influence, please

632
00:42:38,749 --> 00:42:41,542
Okay, you'll need at least an MBA.
And a lot of our people have PhDs

633
00:42:41,662 --> 00:42:44,556
- Isn't being a man enough?
- Actually right now it's kind of the opposite.

634
00:42:44,676 --> 00:42:48,628
You guys are clearly not
doing patriarchy very well

635
00:42:48,648 --> 00:42:50,607
No, we're uh...

636
00:42:50,922 --> 00:42:54,579
We're doing it well, yeah.
We just, uh, hide it better, you know.

637
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,044
Oh

638
00:42:56,369 --> 00:43:00,025
No, I won't let you do
just one appendectomy

639
00:43:00,045 --> 00:43:01,415
- But I'm a man
- But not a doctor

640
00:43:01,435 --> 00:43:02,456
- Please?
- No

641
00:43:02,576 --> 00:43:04,586
- Can I talk to a doctor?
- You are talking to a doctor

642
00:43:04,606 --> 00:43:05,846
- Can you get me a coffee
- No

643
00:43:05,966 --> 00:43:07,100
- And I need a clicky pen
- No

644
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,860
- And a white coat. And a sharp thing
- No. No

645
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,314
- There he is. Doctor!
- Somebody get security

646
00:43:11,434 --> 00:43:15,057
- I'd like to apply for your job of beach?
- So you wanna be a lifeguard?

647
00:43:16,028 --> 00:43:19,744
Oh, I'm not trained to go over there. I'm
trained to stand confidently right here.

648
00:43:19,864 --> 00:43:23,798
- There's nobody in danger here.
- And even if there were, I'm not trained to save them

649
00:43:24,313 --> 00:43:27,484
- Then I can't hire you
- I can't even beach here!

650
00:43:31,285 --> 00:43:33,727
She thinks I'm a fascist?

651
00:43:33,806 --> 00:43:35,750
I don't control the railways

652
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:37,823
or the flow of commerce

653
00:43:40,532 --> 00:43:41,630
- There you are
- Oh no...

654
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:42,912
That went terrible

655
00:43:43,032 --> 00:43:46,983
I need to find somewhere
where I can start patriarchy fresh

656
00:43:50,735 --> 00:43:53,143
- Miss Barbie?
- It's just "Barbie".

657
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:54,874
We're going to need
you to come with us

658
00:43:55,021 --> 00:43:56,521
Oh

659
00:43:57,046 --> 00:43:58,617
- Who are you?
- We're Mattel

660
00:43:58,737 --> 00:44:00,711
- Mattel?
- Mattel

661
00:44:00,766 --> 00:44:04,212
Thank goodness. I've got
to talk to somebody in charge

662
00:44:04,332 --> 00:44:07,688
Everything is backwards here.
Men look at me like I'm an object

663
00:44:07,808 --> 00:44:10,187
Girls hate me,
everyone thinks I'm crazy

664
00:44:10,211 --> 00:44:11,670
and I keep getting arrested!

665
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:14,264
- Would you step this way, ma'am?
- I also just learned to cry

666
00:44:14,471 --> 00:44:16,732
First it I got one tear and
then I got a whole bunch

667
00:44:16,852 --> 00:44:20,729
What to do? Do I follow Barbie into
that scary unmarked black truck car?

668
00:44:21,246 --> 00:44:23,696
A truck car I'd like to have, actually

669
00:44:24,174 --> 00:44:25,161
You're right

670
00:44:25,281 --> 00:44:27,160
She's fine.  It's Mattel

671
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,497
- Yeah
- I know

672
00:44:28,617 --> 00:44:31,164
I'll go back to Barbie Land and
I'll tell the Kens what I've learned

673
00:44:31,284 --> 00:44:32,834
Oh! It's going to be beautiful

674
00:44:33,831 --> 00:44:36,246
- Okay.  Let's go that way
- Back to Barbie Land.

675
00:44:37,494 --> 00:44:39,355
- Hi, bunny boo boo
- Don't call me that

676
00:44:39,475 --> 00:44:40,369
Sorry

677
00:44:40,489 --> 00:44:42,463
I'm off early because
of a crisis at work,

678
00:44:42,487 --> 00:44:44,928
but I thought we could
go get some soft serve

679
00:44:45,248 --> 00:44:47,459
Thank god they
arrested that nutjob

680
00:44:48,987 --> 00:44:52,498
That reality challenged
woman. She thinks she's Barbie

681
00:44:52,618 --> 00:44:55,264
- Wait, what did you say?
- She thinks she's Barbie

682
00:44:55,384 --> 00:44:56,734
She's like really convinced

683
00:44:58,208 --> 00:45:00,002
What are you doing? What are you doing?

684
00:45:00,357 --> 00:45:01,834
Mom.  Mom!

685
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,180
Mom, get back in the car!

686
00:45:06,695 --> 00:45:07,795
Are you kidding me?

687
00:45:09,881 --> 00:45:10,681
Mom!

688
00:45:12,968 --> 00:45:16,478
Mattel! Of course it was you
guys that brought me here

689
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:18,521
Because it definitely
wasn't that Sasha girl

690
00:45:19,979 --> 00:45:21,994
Thanks for the ride. This
has been so much fun

691
00:45:22,922 --> 00:45:25,622
Wow! The mother ship!

692
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,095
Barbie!  So happy to see you!

693
00:45:32,215 --> 00:45:34,363
- Hi!
- Would you like some mineral water?

694
00:45:34,577 --> 00:45:35,827
- Yes! Thank you

695
00:45:39,879 --> 00:45:41,829
I'm used to that
having anything in it

696
00:45:46,198 --> 00:45:46,996
Thank you

697
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:50,139
So we've been very anxious to
get some quality face time with you

698
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:53,892
Of course.  So what can I do to repair
the rift in the space time continuum

699
00:45:53,912 --> 00:45:55,844
and get my feet back
and that one cellulite gone

700
00:45:55,864 --> 00:45:58,524
and just generally not
turn into Weird Barbie?

701
00:45:58,544 --> 00:46:00,451
We have been discussing that very topic

702
00:46:01,743 --> 00:46:05,278
If you're agreeable to it, we
would love it if you could just...

703
00:46:06,137 --> 00:46:08,385
get into that giant box

704
00:46:10,964 --> 00:46:15,373
Get into the box and you'll go back to Barbie
Land. And everything will be as it was

705
00:46:15,737 --> 00:46:17,559
You know what? We should probably get Ken first

706
00:46:19,108 --> 00:46:21,578
- Ken
- You know, Ken. Barbie and Ken

707
00:46:23,144 --> 00:46:24,683
- Yes, Ken! Yeah
- The guy, yeah

708
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:29,060
Back to Barbie Land!

709
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:32,183
I'm going to be so...
I'm going to be sick

710
00:46:33,068 --> 00:46:35,718
Ken isn't something
we're worried about

711
00:46:36,914 --> 00:46:37,914
Ever

712
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:40,868
- Okay, I'll just um... I'll get in the box then
- Alright!

713
00:46:41,113 --> 00:46:41,913
Yes!

714
00:46:43,192 --> 00:46:47,464
Oh, but since I came all this way,
could I just meet the woman in charge?

715
00:46:47,483 --> 00:46:49,083
Your CEO?

716
00:46:49,563 --> 00:46:50,705
Oh, that would be me

717
00:46:50,825 --> 00:46:52,423
- Oh, your CFO
- Me

718
00:46:52,424 --> 00:46:53,518
- Your COO?
- Here

719
00:46:53,643 --> 00:46:55,157
- President of the Barbie Division
- Present

720
00:46:55,277 --> 00:46:58,077
I'm a man with no power,
does that make me a woman?

721
00:46:58,457 --> 00:47:00,190
Are any women in charge?

722
00:47:00,857 --> 00:47:01,857
Listen...

723
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:04,366
I know exactly where
you're going with this and

724
00:47:04,486 --> 00:47:06,939
I have to say I really resent it!

725
00:47:07,059 --> 00:47:09,805
We are a company
literally made of women

726
00:47:09,825 --> 00:47:12,024
We had a woman CEO in the 90s

727
00:47:12,452 --> 00:47:14,272
And there was another one...

728
00:47:15,392 --> 00:47:17,800
at some other time

729
00:47:19,676 --> 00:47:22,063
So that's... that's
two right there

730
00:47:22,503 --> 00:47:27,761
Women are the freaking foundation
of this very long phallic building

731
00:47:28,252 --> 00:47:30,979
We have gender neutral
bathrooms up the wazoo

732
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:33,467
Every single one of
these men love women

733
00:47:33,974 --> 00:47:35,424
I'm a son of a mother

734
00:47:35,904 --> 00:47:37,554
I'm the mother of a son

735
00:47:38,309 --> 00:47:40,787
I'm... I'm the nephew of a woman aunt

736
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:43,740
Some of my best friends are Jewish

737
00:47:45,551 --> 00:47:47,651
What I'm trying to say is...

738
00:47:47,938 --> 00:47:49,821
Get in the box, you jezebel

739
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:52,582
What? I can't
say "jezebel" now?

740
00:47:52,606 --> 00:47:55,112
I haven't been
in a box in ages

741
00:47:55,303 --> 00:47:57,031
You see?  It's easy

742
00:47:58,351 --> 00:47:59,351
Oh, okay

743
00:48:00,772 --> 00:48:03,297
Oh my gosh, I remember this smell

744
00:48:04,051 --> 00:48:06,056
I'm having a real Proustian flashback

745
00:48:06,269 --> 00:48:09,469
Remember Proust Barbie?
That did not sell very well

746
00:48:17,536 --> 00:48:20,054
Do you know what?
Um, before I get in the box

747
00:48:20,174 --> 00:48:22,912
Could I just run to the restroom
and make sure my hair is perfect?

748
00:48:23,032 --> 00:48:24,782
- Fine. Can you be speedy about it?
- Mmhm

749
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:28,492
- Down this way?
- It's just down the hallway

750
00:48:28,612 --> 00:48:30,312
- Thank you
- On the right

751
00:48:34,614 --> 00:48:36,164
Guess she really had
to go the bathroom

752
00:48:37,709 --> 00:48:39,159
Get that Barbie!

753
00:48:41,308 --> 00:48:43,512
Don't you dare push
that button. Let me do it

754
00:48:48,323 --> 00:48:50,023
I said, get that Barbie!

755
00:48:52,042 --> 00:48:53,042
Where's Barbie?

756
00:48:54,451 --> 00:48:55,452
I'm gaining on you

757
00:48:57,439 --> 00:48:58,458
I'll capture you

758
00:49:04,114 --> 00:49:06,098
Quicker to go over the cube

759
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,309
- It's quicker
- Sure

760
00:49:13,809 --> 00:49:15,259
Get that Barbie!

761
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,535
Barbie!

762
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,239
Barbie!

763
00:49:17,964 --> 00:49:18,464
Barbie!

764
00:49:18,589 --> 00:49:19,489
I will get you!

765
00:49:20,497 --> 00:49:20,997
Barbie!

766
00:49:51,122 --> 00:49:53,197
Don't worry, you're safe here

767
00:49:54,675 --> 00:49:56,008
What is this place?

768
00:49:57,262 --> 00:50:00,775
I always find I think
best at kitchen tables

769
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:05,168
Tea?

770
00:50:05,966 --> 00:50:07,666
Uh... yes, please

771
00:50:12,662 --> 00:50:14,431
So a woman does work here

772
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:18,007
Oh sweety, we do
more than work here

773
00:50:47,297 --> 00:50:48,297
What?

774
00:50:49,172 --> 00:50:51,992
- It's because I don't know how to drink tea?
- No

775
00:50:52,598 --> 00:50:54,148
You look different

776
00:50:55,331 --> 00:50:59,247
It's not how I normally look.
I usually look perfect

777
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:00,790
Oh, I don't know

778
00:51:01,546 --> 00:51:03,312
I think you're just right

779
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:14,008
Real World isn't
what I thought it was

780
00:51:14,774 --> 00:51:16,024
It never is

781
00:51:16,211 --> 00:51:17,815
And isn't that marvelous?

782
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,387
Who... are you?

783
00:51:22,686 --> 00:51:23,686
Which way did she go?

784
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:26,885
If you go through that closet

785
00:51:27,005 --> 00:51:29,270
You'll find a stairwell
down to the lobby

786
00:51:29,917 --> 00:51:30,917
Okay

787
00:51:33,982 --> 00:51:35,078
Thank you

788
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:38,194
Ruth

789
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:41,060
Ruth.  Thank you, Ruth

790
00:51:42,277 --> 00:51:43,677
You're welcome, Barbie

791
00:52:00,683 --> 00:52:01,904
Oh, we've got her! There she is!

792
00:52:04,737 --> 00:52:07,264
Keycard! Wait, I don't have my keycard!

793
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:10,835
Get in!

794
00:52:16,251 --> 00:52:18,187
Now!  Get in now!

795
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:20,402
Come on!

796
00:52:24,786 --> 00:52:25,886
Oh no!

797
00:52:25,911 --> 00:52:27,758
Now we're never
going to get Barbie

798
00:52:27,778 --> 00:52:28,968
Oh, we didn't need it

799
00:52:29,088 --> 00:52:30,088
Barbie!

800
00:52:30,937 --> 00:52:32,537
Let's form a plan here

801
00:52:33,324 --> 00:52:36,209
I would normally have shotgun.
I'll get the first one

802
00:52:36,919 --> 00:52:37,969
Hang on!

803
00:52:40,899 --> 00:52:44,026
God, I hope nobody from school
saw us put a life-sized Barbie in our car

804
00:52:44,146 --> 00:52:45,579
- How did this even happen?
- I don't know

805
00:52:45,699 --> 00:52:47,648
How are you here?
You're like an idea

806
00:52:47,768 --> 00:52:48,856
A great idea

807
00:52:48,976 --> 00:52:51,582
So, I've been a
little lonely lately

808
00:52:51,702 --> 00:52:54,402
- And I found those Barbies we used to play with
- I thought we gave those away

809
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:57,783
So I started playing with them and making
drawings like we used to do, remember?

810
00:52:57,903 --> 00:52:59,858
- Because I thought it would be joyful
- Was it?

811
00:52:59,978 --> 00:53:04,412
No, it wasn't. I got sad and weird,
and then the drawings got sad and weird

812
00:53:04,532 --> 00:53:08,740
and maybe because I couldn't be
like you, I ended up making you like me

813
00:53:09,813 --> 00:53:13,549
Did any of these drawings by chance
have thoughts of death and cellulite?

814
00:53:14,301 --> 00:53:15,105
Yes!

815
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:17,054
Irrepressible Thoughts
of Death Barbie!

816
00:53:17,274 --> 00:53:19,809
-Oh my god!
-And cellulite

817
00:53:23,156 --> 00:53:25,406
- I came for you
- You came for me

818
00:53:25,899 --> 00:53:27,849
Those were your memories

819
00:53:56,732 --> 00:53:58,197
Hello? Hello?

820
00:53:58,508 --> 00:54:00,065
Are you two, like, Shining?

821
00:54:00,385 --> 00:54:01,965
No, no, it's nothing like that

822
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:03,386
Are you Shining
with a real Barbie?

823
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,444
No!

824
00:54:04,993 --> 00:54:07,245
I mean, maybe, like a little... yes

825
00:54:07,365 --> 00:54:10,358
I don't even know where to start
with this wishing your Barbie to life crap

826
00:54:10,478 --> 00:54:11,528
Oh Sasha, listen

827
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:15,288
I'm just a boring mom with a boring
job and a daughter who hates me

828
00:54:15,308 --> 00:54:17,453
Can you blame me for
wanting to have a little fun?

829
00:54:18,705 --> 00:54:20,204
I gotta lose these chuckleheads

830
00:54:22,705 --> 00:54:23,705
Mom!

831
00:54:26,146 --> 00:54:27,472
I think I owe you
ladies an apology

832
00:54:27,592 --> 00:54:30,404
I thought that Barbie had
made the Real World better

833
00:54:30,524 --> 00:54:33,460
But the Real World is forever
and irrevocably messed up

834
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:36,360
Well, the Real World is not
perfect, but you inspired me

835
00:54:38,543 --> 00:54:40,444
I love women. I
want to help women

836
00:54:40,464 --> 00:54:42,347
Oh come off it,
everybody hates women

837
00:54:42,367 --> 00:54:45,107
Women hate women and men hate women,
it's the one thing we can all agree on

838
00:54:45,127 --> 00:54:47,528
- Is that true?
- It's complicated. "Hate" is a strong word

839
00:54:47,548 --> 00:54:48,623
Wake up, mom!

840
00:54:49,725 --> 00:54:51,581
I'm wide awake, Sasha!

841
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:57,719
Mom, where did you learn to drive like this?

842
00:54:58,139 --> 00:55:00,728
- There was this guy...
- Was it Dad?

843
00:55:00,751 --> 00:55:02,545
Yeah, yeah... it
was... it was Dad

844
00:55:22,097 --> 00:55:23,097
Okay, duck!

845
00:55:24,098 --> 00:55:25,779
- You look so pretty
- Don't look at me

846
00:55:25,899 --> 00:55:26,759
Okay, sorry

847
00:55:31,384 --> 00:55:34,216
I can't hold them off
forever. Where can we go?

848
00:55:34,536 --> 00:55:37,352
Wait, I have an idea. Can
you get us to Venice Beach?

849
00:55:37,472 --> 00:55:38,472
Sure can!

850
00:55:39,232 --> 00:55:41,878
I love rollerblades.
Where are we going?

851
00:55:41,898 --> 00:55:43,552
- Barbie Land
- What? Mom!

852
00:55:43,672 --> 00:55:45,873
Are you really going
to let Barbie take you

853
00:55:45,897 --> 00:55:47,817
and your tween daughter
to an imaginary land?

854
00:55:47,818 --> 00:55:49,994
Yes, and you want to know why?
Because I never get to do anything

855
00:55:50,114 --> 00:55:51,969
I didn't even go on that cruise
I won at your school raffle

856
00:55:52,089 --> 00:55:54,770
because I didn't have enough vacation
days and your dad's allergic to sun

857
00:55:54,771 --> 00:55:55,065
Oh

858
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:57,927
- What about Dad? We can't just leave him
- He'll be fine

859
00:55:58,539 --> 00:56:01,939
Boligrafos. <i>Boligrafos</i>. Boligrafos

860
00:56:04,164 --> 00:56:06,177
- Yeah, yeah, he'll be fine
- Ready for fun?

861
00:56:06,297 --> 00:56:07,580
Yes!

862
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:11,041
Here we go! Come
on and feel the magic

863
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,148
Where are we?

864
00:56:14,268 --> 00:56:17,005
- How did we get into these clothes?
- How did we get into this vehicle?

865
00:56:17,025 --> 00:56:18,695
When I was a kid I
lost these boots and

866
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:20,535
my mom wouldn't let me
buy a whole new Barbie

867
00:56:20,555 --> 00:56:22,679
- ...just to replace the boots
- They look so good on you!

868
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:23,677
Why thank you!

869
00:56:23,878 --> 00:56:25,940
- Hey you
- She was always my favorite Barbie

870
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:27,550
You're my favorite human

871
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:30,086
Don't tell him, but
I never got a Ken

872
00:56:30,106 --> 00:56:34,203
That's because Ken is totally
superfluous... I didn't say that

873
00:56:34,288 --> 00:56:36,141
Women hold all major
positions of power

874
00:56:36,261 --> 00:56:39,971
control all the money, basically everything
that men do in your world, women do in ours

875
00:56:40,229 --> 00:56:41,752
I mean, that sounds kind of cool

876
00:56:41,776 --> 00:56:43,755
Sasha, look! Dolphins!

877
00:56:44,492 --> 00:56:48,802
<i>Closer I am to fine, yeah</i>

878
00:56:49,034 --> 00:56:51,304
<i>Closer I am to fi...</i>

879
00:56:51,305 --> 00:56:52,689
What is this song?!

880
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:54,698
Oh! And we have a
female president and it's

881
00:56:54,722 --> 00:56:56,911
fun, and work, and
friendship and females 24/7

882
00:56:57,431 --> 00:56:59,484
No giant hands come
in and play with you?

883
00:56:59,508 --> 00:57:00,596
No, that's crazy

884
00:57:00,675 --> 00:57:03,966
Excuse me, have you seen
a group of women on wheels?

885
00:57:03,986 --> 00:57:05,761
Actually yeah, there was
blonde, brunette and a

886
00:57:05,785 --> 00:57:07,559
...tween, they
rollerbladed in that direction

887
00:57:07,647 --> 00:57:08,647
Oh no

888
00:57:09,466 --> 00:57:11,216
First step is always rollerblading

889
00:57:11,336 --> 00:57:13,836
- Excuse me, sir?
- They've gone to Barbie Land

890
00:57:14,677 --> 00:57:16,518
- Oh no
- And she's brought humans there with her

891
00:57:16,538 --> 00:57:18,863
This could mean extremely
weird things for our world

892
00:57:18,887 --> 00:57:19,754
Like what?

893
00:57:19,774 --> 00:57:22,859
Nothing any of our collective
imaginations could ever dream of

894
00:57:22,879 --> 00:57:26,179
A podcast hosted
by two wise trees

895
00:57:26,299 --> 00:57:29,727
Or a choir of 2,000
young fathers

896
00:57:29,847 --> 00:57:32,508
Not even close. We've
got to get to Barbie Land

897
00:57:32,628 --> 00:57:35,631
Go, find some blades now!
Just pick a direction and run

898
00:57:37,116 --> 00:57:40,601
I can practically feel my
heels lifting already. Yes!

899
00:57:40,643 --> 00:57:43,456
This is what I was supposed
to do. Bring you back here

900
00:57:43,576 --> 00:57:45,376
- It feels right
- It does

901
00:57:45,724 --> 00:57:47,812
Okay, this is... oh

902
00:57:48,752 --> 00:57:49,852
That's strange

903
00:57:59,031 --> 00:58:00,291
Incoming brewski beer

904
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:04,162
See that's our
President with the beer

905
00:58:04,382 --> 00:58:07,449
and the cheering squad
is the Supreme Court

906
00:58:07,476 --> 00:58:10,041
This is so much better
than being President

907
00:58:10,574 --> 00:58:12,374
Something's weird today

908
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:14,380
Hi, Barbie!

909
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:17,611
Oh, okay!  Hi, Ken!

910
00:58:17,631 --> 00:58:19,256
Have a brewski beer

911
00:58:19,276 --> 00:58:21,385
My big guy is thirsty

912
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:24,110
Anyway... uh

913
00:58:24,753 --> 00:58:26,037
Wait until you see
my Dream House

914
00:58:26,061 --> 00:58:28,888
Everything I've bought and
own will totally inspire you

915
00:58:28,908 --> 00:58:30,818
And we can change clothes again!

916
00:58:33,739 --> 00:58:34,828
That's the Capitol!

917
00:58:35,306 --> 00:58:37,106
- It's pink?
- Pink!

918
00:58:37,126 --> 00:58:38,126
And that's...

919
00:58:42,662 --> 00:58:45,627
These are the Dream
Houses. This is where I live

920
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,315
You can see through the houses

921
00:58:47,435 --> 00:58:49,618
So does each Barbie
like have their own house?

922
00:58:49,619 --> 00:58:50,463
Mmhmm

923
00:58:50,488 --> 00:58:52,847
That's cool. Where
do the Kens stay?

924
00:58:54,033 --> 00:58:55,403
I don't know

925
00:58:55,719 --> 00:58:58,078
At first I thought the Real
World was run by men

926
00:58:58,198 --> 00:59:01,433
And then, there was a minute,
where I thought it was run by horses

927
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:05,556
But then I realized that
horses just men extenders

928
00:59:07,982 --> 00:59:11,756
Oh, I had that tree house! I
saved up my allowance to buy it.

929
00:59:11,776 --> 00:59:15,559
I've never seen a car like that
before. What happened here?

930
00:59:16,582 --> 00:59:22,044
Everything, basically everything, exists to
expand and elevate the presence of men!

931
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:23,861
- That's amazing
- Beautiful.

932
00:59:23,981 --> 00:59:25,831
- I know
- Barbie's here

933
00:59:26,422 --> 00:59:27,422
Ken?

934
00:59:29,818 --> 00:59:30,981
What have you done?

935
00:59:31,785 --> 00:59:32,924
What are you wearing?

936
00:59:34,413 --> 00:59:37,163
Don't question it, just
roll with it, tiny baby

937
00:59:37,902 --> 00:59:39,236
Don't call me baby

938
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:41,771
What about mini baby?
Like this mini fridge?

939
00:59:42,206 --> 00:59:43,206
No, Ken

940
00:59:43,374 --> 00:59:46,511
This is <i>my</i> Dream House.
It is MY Dream House!

941
00:59:46,512 --> 00:59:47,206
It's mine!

942
00:59:47,331 --> 00:59:49,358
No, this is no longer
Barbie's Dream House

943
00:59:49,461 --> 00:59:51,449
This shall henceforth be known as

944
00:59:51,473 --> 00:59:54,661
Ken's Mojo Dojo Casa House

945
00:59:55,086 --> 00:59:57,962
- You don't have to say dojo and house
- And casa

946
00:59:57,982 --> 01:00:00,707
But you do because
it feels good. Try it

947
01:00:00,727 --> 01:00:02,550
- Mojo Dojo
- No, don't... don't say it

948
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:04,546
Mojo Dojo Casa House

949
01:00:06,516 --> 01:00:07,968
Give it to me straight.
How weird is it?

950
01:00:08,088 --> 01:00:13,746
Whoa, boss. These Mojo Dojo Casa
Houses are literally flying off the shelves

951
01:00:13,836 --> 01:00:15,403
The kids are clamoring for 'em

952
01:00:15,427 --> 01:00:17,194
Ken is on t-shirts, mugs...

953
01:00:17,592 --> 01:00:19,830
- It's the number 1 tattoo
- Oh no

954
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:22,668
Warner Bros has started
auditions for the Ken movie

955
01:00:22,788 --> 01:00:25,087
Which is already
a blockbuster hit

956
01:00:26,616 --> 01:00:28,574
It's happening. The thing
we could never imagine.

957
01:00:28,694 --> 01:00:30,621
- And if we don't get my work lady...
- "Executive assistant"

958
01:00:30,741 --> 01:00:33,899
My executive work lady and someone
who's probably her daughter back here

959
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:36,322
and close the portal, our
worlds could be altered forever

960
01:00:36,442 --> 01:00:39,383
So what does it matter if it's Barbie
or Ken? The money is pouring in

961
01:00:39,503 --> 01:00:41,351
Shame on you, Executive Number 2

962
01:00:41,741 --> 01:00:45,159
You think I spent my entire life in
boardrooms because of a bottom line?

963
01:00:45,398 --> 01:00:48,698
No! I got into this business
because of little girls and their dreams

964
01:00:49,047 --> 01:00:50,869
In the least creep way possible

965
01:00:51,394 --> 01:00:54,087
Now blade faster! Time is running out

966
01:00:54,207 --> 01:00:59,157
Look, I'm just having some brewski
beers at my Dojo Mojo Casa House

967
01:01:00,206 --> 01:01:02,267
- Ken!
- You can stay if you want

968
01:01:02,387 --> 01:01:04,078
As my bride-wife.

969
01:01:04,102 --> 01:01:06,493
Or my long term, low
committment distance girlfriend

970
01:01:06,882 --> 01:01:08,248
- Ugh!
- What do you say?

971
01:01:09,148 --> 01:01:10,398
Brewski beer me?

972
01:01:10,753 --> 01:01:13,068
I will <i>not</i> brewski beer you

973
01:01:14,383 --> 01:01:15,383
That's fine

974
01:01:16,057 --> 01:01:17,574
You know now that you Barbies
aren't around to run everything

975
01:01:17,598 --> 01:01:19,084
We can do our
hair however we like

976
01:01:19,204 --> 01:01:20,123
I have hats

977
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:23,519
Where are my hungry
boys?  Who wants snacks?

978
01:01:24,333 --> 01:01:27,405
Barbie, I am so happy to see you.
Can you believe what is happening?

979
01:01:27,425 --> 01:01:29,075
I know, isn't it great?

980
01:01:29,278 --> 01:01:31,262
Anyone need a brewski beer?

981
01:01:31,482 --> 01:01:34,043
What are you
doing? You're a doctor!

982
01:01:34,063 --> 01:01:35,879
I like being a
helpful decoration

983
01:01:35,999 --> 01:01:38,451
And Alan likes to help me
give all the Kens foot massages

984
01:01:38,671 --> 01:01:40,015
No I don't... I don't like that

985
01:01:40,039 --> 01:01:40,952
We love it!

986
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:43,809
- Ugh, so gross
- I'm so blotto face day drunk right now

987
01:01:44,411 --> 01:01:45,572
Ditto, same... same that

988
01:01:45,592 --> 01:01:49,210
I like not having to make any
decisions. It's like a spa day for my brain

989
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:50,230
Forever

990
01:01:50,909 --> 01:01:52,005
What is wrong with them?

991
01:01:52,025 --> 01:01:54,018
We just explained to them
the immaculate, impeccable,

992
01:01:54,042 --> 01:01:56,498
seamless garment of logic that
is patriarchy and they crumbled

993
01:01:56,618 --> 01:02:00,630
Oh my god, this is like in the 1500s
with the indigenous people and smallpox

994
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,265
They had no defenses against it

995
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:04,473
Yeah!  Buckle up, babe

996
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:07,127
Because Barbie Land...

997
01:02:07,351 --> 01:02:08,780
...is now Ken Land

998
01:02:08,819 --> 01:02:11,316
And it's going to be just like
Century City in Los Angeles

999
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:14,723
Because they had it all
figured out in Century City

1000
01:02:14,969 --> 01:02:17,009
The minute you get
out of your car, you're like

1001
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:19,473
"I can't believe how
great this place is!"

1002
01:02:19,664 --> 01:02:22,336
No no no, they don't
have it figured out in Century City

1003
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,332
Because we failed them

1004
01:02:24,352 --> 01:02:26,231
No, you failed ME!

1005
01:02:32,478 --> 01:02:34,631
Out there I was somebody

1006
01:02:36,913 --> 01:02:38,913
And when I walked
down the street...

1007
01:02:40,836 --> 01:02:43,336
...people respected
me just for who I am

1008
01:02:47,298 --> 01:02:48,398
One lady

1009
01:02:49,218 --> 01:02:50,524
She even asked me for the time

1010
01:02:50,644 --> 01:02:52,335
- No way!
- Way

1011
01:02:55,628 --> 01:02:57,863
And if it weren't for
these technicalities like...

1012
01:02:58,136 --> 01:03:01,300
MBAs, medical degrees,
and... I don't know...

1013
01:03:01,997 --> 01:03:04,567
...swim lessons, I
could've ruled that world

1014
01:03:04,857 --> 01:03:06,955
But I don't need any
of those things here

1015
01:03:12,592 --> 01:03:14,442
Here I'm just a dude

1016
01:03:14,977 --> 01:03:16,056
And you know what?

1017
01:03:20,334 --> 01:03:21,334
That's enough

1018
01:03:21,933 --> 01:03:23,033
TV remote?

1019
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:27,929
Which one is it?

1020
01:03:28,349 --> 01:03:29,349
Oh, it's that one right there

1021
01:03:31,254 --> 01:03:33,308
<i>Call me Mr. Ken President
Prime Minister Man</i>

1022
01:03:33,328 --> 01:03:36,512
<i>Let's recap all the amazing changes
and innovations thanks to the Kens</i>

1023
01:03:36,513 --> 01:03:38,553
<i>The Nobel Prize in horses...</i>

1024
01:03:38,573 --> 01:03:40,459
<i>Goes to... Ken!</i>

1025
01:03:41,014 --> 01:03:43,014
Ken! Ken! Ken! Ken!

1026
01:03:44,314 --> 01:03:45,014
<i>Wow</i>

1027
01:03:45,139 --> 01:03:47,139
<i>And now you're making
it permanent with a</i>

1028
01:03:47,163 --> 01:03:50,084
<i>special with election to
change the Constitution</i>

1029
01:03:50,104 --> 01:03:52,265
<i>That's right, in just 48
hours all the Kens will</i>

1030
01:03:52,289 --> 01:03:54,774
<i>head to the polls and vote
to change the Constitution</i>

1031
01:03:54,894 --> 01:03:58,423
<i>To a government for Kens,
of the Kens, and by the Kens!</i>

1032
01:04:02,804 --> 01:04:04,697
You can't do this

1033
01:04:04,817 --> 01:04:07,551
This is Barbie Land. The
Barbies worked hard

1034
01:04:07,571 --> 01:04:10,521
and they dreamed hard to
make it everything that it is you-

1035
01:04:11,443 --> 01:04:14,243
You can't just undo it in a day

1036
01:04:14,873 --> 01:04:17,173
Literally and
figuratively watch me

1037
01:04:18,427 --> 01:04:19,477
Now...

1038
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:21,189
If you'll excuse me

1039
01:04:22,199 --> 01:04:24,737
This is my Mojo Dojo Casa House

1040
01:04:24,857 --> 01:04:25,957
It's not...

1041
01:04:26,477 --> 01:04:28,927
Barbie's Mojo Dojo Casa House

1042
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:31,980
Right?

1043
01:04:36,447 --> 01:04:37,797
How's that feel?

1044
01:04:41,299 --> 01:04:43,349
It is <i>not</i> fun, is it?

1045
01:04:45,229 --> 01:04:47,771
It's Boys' Night!

1046
01:05:03,098 --> 01:05:05,198
Every night is Boys' Night.

1047
01:05:17,469 --> 01:05:21,495
Barbie! Take your
lady fashions with you!

1048
01:05:21,615 --> 01:05:24,636
Take your Celebrate Disco Bell Bottoms

1049
01:05:26,301 --> 01:05:30,831
And your Icecapade Pretty
Practice Suit and Dazzling Show Skirt

1050
01:05:31,583 --> 01:05:35,620
- These are archival
- Your Pajama Jam in Amsterdam set!

1051
01:05:36,455 --> 01:05:39,104
And your Pretty Paisley Palazzo Pants!

1052
01:05:40,401 --> 01:05:43,435
- Not the Palazzo!
- And get out!

1053
01:05:46,076 --> 01:05:48,064
Leave the skirt!

1054
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:52,259
Honey

1055
01:05:52,379 --> 01:05:55,642
Why did you wish me to your
messed up world using your

1056
01:05:56,446 --> 01:05:59,358
...complicated human
thoughts and feelings?

1057
01:05:59,478 --> 01:06:02,035
- What?
- Barbie Land was perfect before

1058
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:05,150
I was perfect before

1059
01:06:06,028 --> 01:06:09,728
I'm so sorry, I... I wasn't
trying to do anything

1060
01:06:09,748 --> 01:06:11,148
Don't apologize

1061
01:06:11,569 --> 01:06:13,073
Don't blame my mom

1062
01:06:13,706 --> 01:06:14,964
Oh Sasha, that's sweet

1063
01:06:15,084 --> 01:06:18,091
Maybe you wished <i>us</i>.
Maybe it's your fault, Barbie.

1064
01:06:18,211 --> 01:06:22,231
No, I didn't wish anything.
I never wanted anything to change

1065
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:25,266
Oh, honey, that's life

1066
01:06:26,045 --> 01:06:27,745
It's all change

1067
01:06:28,944 --> 01:06:30,344
Well that's...

1068
01:06:30,369 --> 01:06:31,969
That's terrifying

1069
01:06:36,602 --> 01:06:37,702
I don't want that

1070
01:06:38,927 --> 01:06:41,727
Not my life. No thank you

1071
01:06:41,815 --> 01:06:44,997
Just... no. I don't want this

1072
01:06:51,361 --> 01:06:55,157
I'm just going to sit here and wait
and hope that one of the more...

1073
01:06:55,408 --> 01:06:57,258
...leadership oriented Barbies just...

1074
01:06:57,622 --> 01:07:00,702
...snaps out of it, does
something about this whole mess

1075
01:07:01,022 --> 01:07:03,400
I really understand this feeling

1076
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:06,552
It's basically like being a
human person all the time

1077
01:07:06,572 --> 01:07:08,982
Please just leave me
here, just leave me, go back

1078
01:07:09,006 --> 01:07:11,616
to your messed up world
and just leave me to mine?

1079
01:07:12,573 --> 01:07:14,658
- So you're just going to give up?
- Yes.

1080
01:07:19,797 --> 01:07:20,797
Okay

1081
01:07:21,229 --> 01:07:25,231
You know I almost feel bad for you, but you
are exactly what I thought you were

1082
01:07:26,688 --> 01:07:27,688
Um

1083
01:07:28,713 --> 01:07:30,369
Let's go, honey, let's just...

1084
01:07:30,489 --> 01:07:33,089
- Okay, how do we even...
- Do everything we did in reverse

1085
01:07:35,642 --> 01:07:36,642
Unbelievable

1086
01:07:37,236 --> 01:07:39,137
Come on, mom. She
doesn't deserve you

1087
01:07:44,237 --> 01:07:46,341
This is the lowest
I've ever been

1088
01:07:47,174 --> 01:07:50,020
Emotionally and physically

1089
01:07:51,739 --> 01:07:55,495
<i>Okay kids, it's time to run out
and get the new Depression Barbie</i>

1090
01:07:55,515 --> 01:07:57,524
<i>She wears sweatpants
all day and night</i>

1091
01:07:57,544 --> 01:07:59,755
<i>She spent 7 hours
today on Instagram</i>

1092
01:07:59,779 --> 01:08:01,989
<i>Looking at her estranged
best friend's engagement photos</i>

1093
01:08:02,309 --> 01:08:04,363

sized bag of Starbursts</i>

1094
01:08:04,383 --> 01:08:06,916
<i>And now her jaw is
killing her and she's going</i>

1095
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:09,069
<i>to watch the BBC's Pride and Prejudice</i>

1096
01:08:09,089 --> 01:08:12,135
<i>for the seventh time

reprehensible connection</i>

<i>Anxiety, panic attacks,

1100
01:08:20,691 --> 01:08:22,857
Barbie, Barbie. Wake up

1101
01:08:25,849 --> 01:08:27,399
I'm like you now

1102
01:08:27,595 --> 01:08:29,306
Ugly and unwanted

1103
01:08:30,576 --> 01:08:31,576
Thanks

1104
01:08:32,546 --> 01:08:34,076
Let's get her in
the back, come on

1105
01:08:35,715 --> 01:08:37,463
- Isn't this great?
- Yes

1106
01:08:37,583 --> 01:08:40,149
- Wait until you see the boat
- The boat

1107
01:08:41,963 --> 01:08:43,539
Beautiful countryside

1108
01:08:44,982 --> 01:08:46,945
<i>He said he could see through me</i>

1109
01:08:46,965 --> 01:08:50,556
<i>I spent four years
prostrate to the higher mind</i>

1110
01:08:50,731 --> 01:08:53,527
<i>Got my paper and I was free</i>

1111
01:08:54,650 --> 01:08:59,342
<i>I went to the doctor,
I went to the mountains</i>

1112
01:08:59,343 --> 01:09:04,281
<i>I looked to the children,
I drank from the fountains</i>

1113
01:09:04,282 --> 01:09:06,949
<i>We interrupt to this broadcast
to bring you our new radio station</i>

1114
01:09:07,069 --> 01:09:09,080
<i>Only playing Ken's favorite song</i>

1115
01:09:14,944 --> 01:09:16,994
Turn this song off, for Christ's sake!

1116
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:24,989
- Who are you?
- I'm Alan

1117
01:09:25,109 --> 01:09:29,021
- Oh you are Alan, that's great!
- Don't tell the Kens, I'm trying to escape

1118
01:09:29,141 --> 01:09:32,445
I cannot sit on one more leather
couch. It's going to break my spirit

1119
01:09:32,765 --> 01:09:36,203
As soon as they figure out how to
build that wall sideways and not just up

1120
01:09:36,323 --> 01:09:38,620
No one is going to
be able to get in or out

1121
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:40,323
So we want to leave,
we'd better make a run for it

1122
01:09:40,347 --> 01:09:41,597
No Alan, you can't go

1123
01:09:41,617 --> 01:09:43,094
Having a Barbie in
the Real World is what

1124
01:09:43,118 --> 01:09:44,782
caused all these
problems in the first place

1125
01:09:44,902 --> 01:09:47,095
Not one person would care
if Alan was in the Real World

1126
01:09:47,119 --> 01:09:48,350
In fact, it's happened before

1127
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:50,179
All of NSYNC, Alan

1128
01:09:50,507 --> 01:09:52,511
Yes, even him. So come on!

1129
01:09:52,631 --> 01:09:53,631
Hey, you there!

1130
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:57,320
- What... what do we do?
- Just get in the car and keep it singing

1131
01:09:57,540 --> 01:09:59,635
Hey man! <i>Be ready for anything</i>

1132
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:01,657
- Who are you?
- I'm Alan

1133
01:10:01,777 --> 01:10:04,575
I'm uh... I'm Ken's buddy.
Yeah. All his clothes fit me

1134
01:10:08,156 --> 01:10:09,156
Get in the car

1135
01:10:14,197 --> 01:10:16,879
- Wait, you don't have a driver's license
- Well this car doesn't have an engine

1136
01:10:17,142 --> 01:10:18,142
Fine

1137
01:10:18,772 --> 01:10:21,306
KINGDOM OF KEN

1138
01:10:21,981 --> 01:10:24,618
- What are you doing? We gotta go
- We have to go back

1139
01:10:24,738 --> 01:10:27,386
Barbie Land needs
saving. Barbie needs saving

1140
01:10:27,853 --> 01:10:29,076
Wh... you hate Barbie

1141
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:31,194
But you don't. You've always
believed in what she could be

1142
01:10:31,214 --> 01:10:34,702
Yeah, well, I was wrong.
Barbie gave up. The Kens won

1143
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:37,311
You have to try. Even if...

1144
01:10:37,431 --> 01:10:39,757
Even if you can't make it
perfect, you can make it better

1145
01:10:39,877 --> 01:10:41,723
I can't make anything
better. I'm the one who ruined

1146
01:10:41,747 --> 01:10:43,588
Barbie Land with my stupid
drawings in the first place

1147
01:10:43,608 --> 01:10:45,609
They're not stupid,
they're amazing

1148
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:49,508
You like my drawings?

1149
01:10:49,857 --> 01:10:52,665
They're weird and dark and... crazy

1150
01:10:53,162 --> 01:10:54,976
Everything you pretend not to be

1151
01:10:57,010 --> 01:11:00,338
I am.... I am. I'm weird
and I'm dark and I'm crazy

1152
01:11:03,481 --> 01:11:05,232
Easy. Easy...

1153
01:11:07,759 --> 01:11:08,659
 Okay

1154
01:11:09,284 --> 01:11:11,184
- Do you want some more Alan?
- No!

1155
01:11:12,386 --> 01:11:15,736
- We have to get out of here right now
- Shut up, Alan!  We're going back

1156
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:18,058
Let's go get my doll

1157
01:11:21,995 --> 01:11:23,655
I'll never get out of here

1158
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:25,407
Where do we find Barbie?

1159
01:11:25,431 --> 01:11:27,033
There's only
one place she'd be

1160
01:11:29,095 --> 01:11:30,355
You're a writer

1161
01:11:30,475 --> 01:11:33,301
This is your Nobel prize.
Remember winning it?

1162
01:11:33,516 --> 01:11:36,231
It's useless trying to deprogram
her, I already did everything I could

1163
01:11:36,255 --> 01:11:37,152
Oh my god

1164
01:11:37,856 --> 01:11:39,667
I don't even know how I got here

1165
01:11:39,787 --> 01:11:41,191
I don't deserve this

1166
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:43,042
Um, I'd like to thank...

1167
01:11:43,273 --> 01:11:44,073
Ken

1168
01:11:44,996 --> 01:11:46,396
Thank you, Ken

1169
01:11:46,807 --> 01:11:48,263
I love you, Ken

1170
01:11:48,673 --> 01:11:50,345
The fork in my soup
is this Barb...

1171
01:11:50,369 --> 01:11:53,241
Why didn't the
brainwashing work on you?

1172
01:11:53,338 --> 01:11:56,358
My exposure to the Real World
must have made be immune

1173
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:59,273
Either you're brainwashed
or you're weird and ugly

1174
01:11:59,297 --> 01:12:00,394
There is no in between

1175
01:12:00,414 --> 01:12:01,592
Sing it, sister

1176
01:12:01,687 --> 01:12:04,033
Well, get ready kids.
Because in 48 hours...

1177
01:12:04,057 --> 01:12:05,603
Barbie Land becomes Ken Land

1178
01:12:05,622 --> 01:12:07,955
Come on, gang. We'll find
Barbie at the top of these stairs

1179
01:12:08,075 --> 01:12:09,525
The Kens... they found us

1180
01:12:13,557 --> 01:12:14,557
Ken!

1181
01:12:14,935 --> 01:12:15,935
Ken?

1182
01:12:19,743 --> 01:12:20,943
Hello?

1183
01:12:21,711 --> 01:12:23,609
Humans. We're fine

1184
01:12:23,729 --> 01:12:24,779
And Alan

1185
01:12:25,596 --> 01:12:28,237
Come into my Weird House, hi!
I'm Weird Barbie

1186
01:12:28,357 --> 01:12:31,361
I am in the splits, I have a funky
haircut and I smell like basement

1187
01:12:31,481 --> 01:12:34,271
Oh my god, I had a Weird Barbie!

1188
01:12:34,391 --> 01:12:37,361
- Yeah, you did
- You make then weird by playing too hard

1189
01:12:37,585 --> 01:12:38,405
It's cool

1190
01:12:38,829 --> 01:12:41,309
That's Sugar Daddy Ken,
and Earring Magic Ken

1191
01:12:41,429 --> 01:12:42,616
Mattel discontinued them

1192
01:12:42,736 --> 01:12:45,396
- Sugar daddy?
- No no no, I'm not a sugar daddy

1193
01:12:45,516 --> 01:12:47,916
This is Sugar. And I'm her daddy

1194
01:12:48,158 --> 01:12:49,931
And I have an
earring, a magic earring

1195
01:12:50,051 --> 01:12:51,901
These were actual Kens

1196
01:12:52,419 --> 01:12:54,577
More discontinued Barbies

1197
01:12:54,697 --> 01:12:57,603
- Growing Up Skipper? May I?
- Okay

1198
01:12:57,723 --> 01:12:58,623
Watch this

1199
01:13:00,002 --> 01:13:02,469
- Her boobs grow!
- Why would they do that?

1200
01:13:02,589 --> 01:13:04,239
And Barbie Video Girl?

1201
01:13:04,259 --> 01:13:06,019
I have a TV in my back

1202
01:13:06,039 --> 01:13:09,214
You know whose dream that
is?  Nobody.  Nobody's dream

1203
01:13:09,534 --> 01:13:11,504
And that's Barbie
Barbie, of course

1204
01:13:11,524 --> 01:13:13,774
She's not dead, she's just
having an existential crisis

1205
01:13:14,054 --> 01:13:15,244
Okay, come on

1206
01:13:18,792 --> 01:13:19,792
What's wrong?

1207
01:13:23,718 --> 01:13:24,818
I'm not...

1208
01:13:25,697 --> 01:13:27,183
pretty anymore

1209
01:13:29,161 --> 01:13:31,028
What? You're so pretty

1210
01:13:31,148 --> 01:13:34,433
I'm not "Stereotypical
Barbie" pretty

1211
01:13:34,553 --> 01:13:36,631
<i>Note to the filmakers:
Margot Robbie is the wrong</i>

1212
01:13:36,655 --> 01:13:38,733
<i>person to cast if you
want to make this point</i>

1213
01:13:38,852 --> 01:13:40,242
But you're beautiful

1214
01:13:40,857 --> 01:13:42,627
It's not just that. I'm not...

1215
01:13:44,358 --> 01:13:46,150
smart enough to be interesting

1216
01:13:46,270 --> 01:13:48,583
- You're so smart
- I can't do brain surgery

1217
01:13:48,703 --> 01:13:50,358
I've never flown a plane

1218
01:13:51,991 --> 01:13:53,441
I'm not the President

1219
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:57,093
No one on the
Supreme Court is me

1220
01:13:59,173 --> 01:14:00,273
I'm not...

1221
01:14:00,991 --> 01:14:02,191
good enough...

1222
01:14:02,699 --> 01:14:03,999
for anything

1223
01:14:10,411 --> 01:14:13,161
It is literally impossible
to be a woman

1224
01:14:15,026 --> 01:14:17,226
You are so beautiful

1225
01:14:17,346 --> 01:14:19,882
And so smart,
and it kills me that

1226
01:14:19,906 --> 01:14:22,042
you don't think
you're good enough

1227
01:14:22,290 --> 01:14:23,288
Like...

1228
01:14:23,541 --> 01:14:26,191
we have to always
be extraordinary

1229
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:28,198
But somehow

1230
01:14:28,276 --> 01:14:31,402
we're always doing it wrong

1231
01:14:33,989 --> 01:14:35,895
You have to be
thin, but not too thin

1232
01:14:36,015 --> 01:14:38,190
And you can never
say you want to be thin

1233
01:14:38,214 --> 01:14:40,581
You have to say you
want to be healthy

1234
01:14:40,601 --> 01:14:43,371
But also you have to be thin

1235
01:14:43,972 --> 01:14:46,805
You have money,
but can't ask for money

1236
01:14:46,825 --> 01:14:48,375
Because that's crass

1237
01:14:50,512 --> 01:14:52,418
You have to be boss,
but can't be mean

1238
01:14:52,538 --> 01:14:55,596
You have to lead, but you
can't squash other people's ideas

1239
01:14:55,716 --> 01:14:57,596
You're supposed to
love being a mother, but

1240
01:14:57,620 --> 01:14:59,499
don't talk about your
kids all the damn time

1241
01:14:59,619 --> 01:15:04,248
You have to be a career woman, but
also always be looking out for other people

1242
01:15:04,689 --> 01:15:07,784
You have to answer for men's
bad behavior, which is insane

1243
01:15:07,904 --> 01:15:10,851
But if you point that out,
you're accused of complaining

1244
01:15:11,041 --> 01:15:12,752
You're supposed to
stay pretty for men, but

1245
01:15:12,776 --> 01:15:15,089
not so pretty that you
tempt them too much or

1246
01:15:15,109 --> 01:15:18,240
that you threaten other women because you're
supposed to be a part of the sisterhood

1247
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:19,821
but always stand out

1248
01:15:19,941 --> 01:15:22,074
And always be grateful

1249
01:15:22,574 --> 01:15:25,815
But never forget that the system is
rigged, so find a way to acknowledge that

1250
01:15:25,935 --> 01:15:27,929
But also, always be grateful

1251
01:15:28,026 --> 01:15:29,925
You have to never get old

1252
01:15:30,045 --> 01:15:32,857
Never be rude, never show off

1253
01:15:32,977 --> 01:15:37,052
Never be selfish, never fall
down, never fail, never show fear

1254
01:15:37,271 --> 01:15:40,236
Never get out of
line, it's too hard

1255
01:15:40,356 --> 01:15:44,487
It's too contradictory and nobody
gives you a medal or says "thank you"

1256
01:15:44,607 --> 01:15:46,941
And it turns out, in fact,
that not only are you doing

1257
01:15:46,965 --> 01:15:49,999
everything wrong, but
also everything is your fault

1258
01:15:55,273 --> 01:15:56,722
I'm just so tired...

1259
01:15:57,316 --> 01:16:02,652
of watching myself and
every single other woman

1260
01:16:02,884 --> 01:16:07,032
tie herself into knots
so that people will like us

1261
01:16:10,556 --> 01:16:12,224
And if all of that...

1262
01:16:13,424 --> 01:16:16,303
is also true for a doll...

1263
01:16:19,481 --> 01:16:21,631
representing a woman...

1264
01:16:24,052 --> 01:16:26,519
then I don't even know

1265
01:16:32,787 --> 01:16:33,937
Wait...

1266
01:16:35,138 --> 01:16:36,638
I did write a book

1267
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:39,378
It's like I've been in a dream

1268
01:16:39,498 --> 01:16:42,412
where I was somehow
really invested

1269
01:16:42,436 --> 01:16:45,471
in the Zack Snyder
cut of <i>Justice League</i>

1270
01:16:47,038 --> 01:16:50,024
But what you said
broke me out of it

1271
01:16:51,076 --> 01:16:53,123
- Really?
- Yeah

1272
01:16:53,154 --> 01:16:54,862
You're back!  She's back!

1273
01:16:54,982 --> 01:16:57,995
By giving voice to the cognitive
dissonance required to be a woman

1274
01:16:58,015 --> 01:17:00,581
under the patriarchy,
you robbed it of its power

1275
01:17:00,601 --> 01:17:01,601
Yes

1276
01:17:03,137 --> 01:17:04,211
I just said all of that

1277
01:17:04,331 --> 01:17:06,714
Hell yes, White Savior Barbie!

1278
01:17:06,966 --> 01:17:09,916
No, it was your mom.
Your mom did the saving

1279
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:11,858
We have to stop the Kens

1280
01:17:11,882 --> 01:17:14,382
And you need to say all of
those things to the other Barbies

1281
01:17:14,402 --> 01:17:15,760
- That's the key
- Got it

1282
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:18,125
But how are we going to get
the Barbies away from their Kens?

1283
01:17:18,363 --> 01:17:20,202
We have experience
with a world like this one

1284
01:17:20,322 --> 01:17:22,142
Do you have a
map of Barbie Land?

1285
01:17:22,262 --> 01:17:23,642
What do you think?

1286
01:17:26,676 --> 01:17:28,336
- Wow
- Thanks, I built it

1287
01:17:28,337 --> 01:17:29,131
Okay, here's the deal

1288
01:17:29,156 --> 01:17:32,988
It's not just about how they see us,
it's about how they see themselves

1289
01:17:33,108 --> 01:17:35,915
Ken Land contains the
seeds of its own destruction

1290
01:17:35,935 --> 01:17:38,296
First we have to get the
Barbies away from their Kens

1291
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:41,406
We could use a decoy
Barbie who pretends

1292
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:43,636
to be brainwashed.
That should be you

1293
01:17:50,505 --> 01:17:52,787
<i>Distract them by appearing
helpless and confused</i>

1294
01:17:52,907 --> 01:17:54,864
<i>Kens cannot resist
a damsel in distress</i>

1295
01:17:54,984 --> 01:17:57,604
<i>You have to make them
believe that they're complacent</i>

1296
01:17:57,804 --> 01:18:00,642
<i>That they have the power.
And when their guard is down...</i>

1297
01:18:00,762 --> 01:18:02,512
<i>You take the power back</i>

1298
01:18:05,314 --> 01:18:07,484
The influence that
Porsche 356 has

1299
01:18:07,508 --> 01:18:09,677
had on the motoring
world as a whole...

1300
01:18:09,797 --> 01:18:10,953
it can't be overstated

1301
01:18:11,073 --> 01:18:13,033
Ugh, Photoshop is so hard

1302
01:18:13,057 --> 01:18:15,316
I just don't understand
how to use the select tool

1303
01:18:15,436 --> 01:18:17,710
Honey, you can only
use the select tool if

1304
01:18:17,734 --> 01:18:19,707
the layer is highlighted.
Let me show you

1305
01:18:19,727 --> 01:18:22,326
My tiny head is just swimming
with technical jargon like...

1306
01:18:22,446 --> 01:18:26,004
Color bands and magnetic
lassos and bitmap

1307
01:18:26,124 --> 01:18:28,434
Do you think that you, with
strong arms, can explain to me...

1308
01:18:28,554 --> 01:18:30,691
- What's happening?
- Alan, go around

1309
01:18:32,901 --> 01:18:34,105
- But what about Ken?
- No no no...

1310
01:18:34,225 --> 01:18:36,132
- No, but I love him!
- Come on, Alan

1311
01:18:37,863 --> 01:18:39,298
What's going to happen to Ken?

1312
01:18:39,418 --> 01:18:40,468
Just listen

1313
01:18:41,043 --> 01:18:43,646
You have to be their mommies,
but no remind them of their mommy

1314
01:18:43,766 --> 01:18:46,099
Any power you have must
be masked under a giggle

1315
01:18:48,865 --> 01:18:49,833
What happened?

1316
01:18:49,853 --> 01:18:51,749
One minute I was
President and then the next

1317
01:18:51,773 --> 01:18:54,230
I was cutting
Ken's steak for him?

1318
01:18:54,548 --> 01:18:56,206
Welcome back, Madame President

1319
01:18:56,326 --> 01:18:59,884
Then we'll recruit the now
un-brainwashed Barbies to our cause

1320
01:19:00,004 --> 01:19:01,589
<i>They can be the new decoys</i>

1321
01:19:01,709 --> 01:19:04,209
<i>You can tell them that you've
never seen The Godfather</i>

1322
01:19:04,233 --> 01:19:06,402
<i>and that you'd love
them to explain it to you</i>

1323
01:19:07,371 --> 01:19:10,458
- Ooh, are you guys watching <i>The God Father</i>?
- <i>The Godfather</i>

1324
01:19:10,578 --> 01:19:13,310
- I've never seen it!
- Oh my god, you've never seen <i>The Godfather</i>?

1325
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:16,361
This movie is a rich blend of
Coppola's aesthetic genius

1326
01:19:16,381 --> 01:19:19,400
and a triumph to Robert Evans and
the architecture of the 70s studio system

1327
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:22,065
Can you just start the movie over
and just talk through the whole thing?

1328
01:19:22,085 --> 01:19:25,428
You have to find a way to reject a man's
advances without damaging their egos

1329
01:19:25,548 --> 01:19:27,444
Because if you say yes
to them, you're a tramp

1330
01:19:27,468 --> 01:19:29,198
but if you say no to
them, you're a prude

1331
01:19:31,057 --> 01:19:33,449
- I don't want to touch a foot
- No, you don't

1332
01:19:33,569 --> 01:19:36,034
Another one: be
confused about money

1333
01:19:36,154 --> 01:19:38,497
I just have all my money
in a savings account

1334
01:19:38,617 --> 01:19:41,450
That's totally wrong! You need
treasury bonds, corporate bonds, CDs...

1335
01:19:41,570 --> 01:19:43,173
No one has CDs anymore!

1336
01:19:43,293 --> 01:19:46,098
Ah sweetheart, you are so
cute when you're confused

1337
01:19:46,218 --> 01:19:50,350
But no, not music. CD
stands for certificate of deposit

1338
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:53,510
Stephen Malkmus really harnessed
the cervic toxing of Lou Reed

1339
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:56,445
with post-punk influences
such as <i>Wire</i> and <i>The Fall</i>.

1340
01:19:56,565 --> 01:19:59,669
- What am I wearing?  I would never choose this
- Because you're a physicist

1341
01:19:59,789 --> 01:20:01,690
- Do you want some pants?
- Yeah

1342
01:20:03,903 --> 01:20:05,188
Welcome back, Barbie.

1343
01:20:05,208 --> 01:20:08,176
Gee, I am so awkward
and don't feel pretty at all

1344
01:20:08,296 --> 01:20:09,985
And will anyone ever like me?

1345
01:20:10,205 --> 01:20:11,636
<i>Or distract them
with the old standby</i>

1346
01:20:11,756 --> 01:20:14,115
<i>Wearing glasses so that they
can discover that you're pretty</i>

1347
01:20:14,235 --> 01:20:16,094
- May I?
- Sure, go ahead

1348
01:20:20,611 --> 01:20:23,378
There. Now we see
your beautiful face

1349
01:20:24,493 --> 01:20:27,928
And then there's pretending
to be terrible at every sport ever

1350
01:20:28,048 --> 01:20:29,913
Here, let me show you

1351
01:20:30,304 --> 01:20:32,011
Here, let me show you

1352
01:20:32,131 --> 01:20:34,181
- Here, let me show you
- Here, let me show you

1353
01:20:34,301 --> 01:20:36,211
Here, let us show you

1354
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:39,748
We do this until every single
Barbie is deprogrammed

1355
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:41,760
and ready to take back Barbie Land

1356
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:42,680
Yes!

1357
01:20:49,222 --> 01:20:52,657
Tomorrow the Kens vote
to change the Constitution

1358
01:20:52,914 --> 01:20:54,402
So we have to get there first

1359
01:20:54,426 --> 01:20:56,157
The final stage
of our of the plan

1360
01:20:56,277 --> 01:20:58,166
To turn the Kens
against each other

1361
01:20:58,286 --> 01:21:00,443
Now that they think
they have power over you

1362
01:21:00,563 --> 01:21:03,783
You make them question whether
they have enough power over each other

1363
01:21:04,233 --> 01:21:05,688
What if this doesn't work?

1364
01:21:06,574 --> 01:21:07,674
What if he doesn't...

1365
01:21:09,368 --> 01:21:10,879
...like me anymore?

1366
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:15,063
- He likes you
- He was really upset

1367
01:21:16,398 --> 01:21:17,848
Because he likes you

1368
01:21:18,323 --> 01:21:20,241
And because he
knows deep down that...

1369
01:21:20,544 --> 01:21:23,874
- ...you don't like him the same way
- It still doesn't mean I want to hurt him

1370
01:21:25,263 --> 01:21:26,663
He took your house

1371
01:21:27,153 --> 01:21:30,355
He brainwashed your friends,
he wants to control the government

1372
01:21:30,475 --> 01:21:31,475
True

1373
01:21:31,812 --> 01:21:33,799
- Girl
- Yeah

1374
01:21:35,964 --> 01:21:38,014
It's like I'm a woman already

1375
01:21:38,318 --> 01:21:39,418
Welcome

1376
01:21:39,897 --> 01:21:41,134
Is this what it's like?

1377
01:21:42,618 --> 01:21:44,277
- It's time
- I'm ready

1378
01:21:45,742 --> 01:21:46,892
Thank you

1379
01:21:47,457 --> 01:21:48,657
Here I go

1380
01:21:55,399 --> 01:21:56,199
Hi!

1381
01:22:06,427 --> 01:22:07,377
Oh, hey

1382
01:22:08,093 --> 01:22:08,909
You've caught me reading

1383
01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:14,310
-I've been thinking, Ken Land?
- Kendom

1384
01:22:14,312 --> 01:22:16,044
- Kendom
- Kendom Land

1385
01:22:16,164 --> 01:22:17,380
- Land of...
- Land of the Free and the Men

1386
01:22:17,381 --> 01:22:20,144
- Right, well, this place... is...
- Kendom Land

1387
01:22:20,569 --> 01:22:21,619
Really great

1388
01:22:21,835 --> 01:22:23,817
And the Kens really
are just better at

1389
01:22:23,841 --> 01:22:25,662
ruling than the
Barbies ever were

1390
01:22:25,961 --> 01:22:28,742
Well, we just took patriarchy
and, you know, made it patriarchy

1391
01:22:28,862 --> 01:22:31,232
- Yeah, well, I was thinking...
- Yes?

1392
01:22:31,252 --> 01:22:34,989
I'm ready to be your
long term distance

1393
01:22:35,009 --> 01:22:37,071
low committment
casual girlfriend

1394
01:22:37,191 --> 01:22:38,792
if you'll still have me

1395
01:22:40,576 --> 01:22:42,726
- Can you just hold on for one second?
- Oh, okay

1396
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:49,416
Sublime!

1397
01:22:53,754 --> 01:22:55,654
I don't know, I'm going
to have to think about that

1398
01:22:55,978 --> 01:22:56,978
Oh

1399
01:22:58,279 --> 01:22:59,115
Please?

1400
01:23:02,031 --> 01:23:03,874
Okay. Come on in

1401
01:23:04,304 --> 01:23:06,548
- I'll play the guitar at you
- Oh, yay!

1402
01:24:15,276 --> 01:24:18,086
<i>This is the final
stage of our plan</i>

1403
01:24:18,950 --> 01:24:21,112
<i>Give them their dream come true</i>

1404
01:24:21,695 --> 01:24:23,601
<i>And at the peak
of their happiness</i>

1405
01:24:23,721 --> 01:24:26,695
<i>when they think you
actually care about this song...</i>

1406
01:24:30,012 --> 01:24:31,662
<i>You take it all away</i>

1407
01:24:44,543 --> 01:24:45,647
What are you texting?

1408
01:24:45,767 --> 01:24:47,667
- What?
- <i>Who</i> are you texting?

1409
01:24:48,553 --> 01:24:50,304
- No one
- Hm, let me just...

1410
01:24:51,813 --> 01:24:54,056
- Ken!
- Sorry, one sec

1411
01:24:56,588 --> 01:24:58,636
That's a beautiful
song that you're playing

1412
01:24:59,327 --> 01:25:00,577
Did you write it?

1413
01:25:00,697 --> 01:25:02,517
Yes. Do you want to sit
here and watch me do it

1414
01:25:02,637 --> 01:25:05,061
while I stare uncomfortably into
your eyes for four and a half minutes?

1415
01:25:05,181 --> 01:25:06,181
I would love that

1416
01:25:07,242 --> 01:25:08,642
Sorry, one sec

1417
01:25:10,286 --> 01:25:11,186
I'll be right back

1418
01:25:14,858 --> 01:25:17,794
<i>You play on their egos
and their petty jealousies</i>

1419
01:25:17,914 --> 01:25:19,902
<i>and you turn them
against each other</i>

1420
01:25:20,022 --> 01:25:20,822
One sec

1421
01:25:25,233 --> 01:25:26,183
Sorry

1422
01:25:26,841 --> 01:25:30,338
<i>While they're fighting,
we take back Barbie Land</i>

1423
01:25:32,682 --> 01:25:37,348
Does the title of long term distance casual
low committment girlfriend mean nothing?

1424
01:25:37,468 --> 01:25:41,293
- What do we do?
- We beach every individual one of them off

1425
01:25:41,495 --> 01:25:42,295
No

1426
01:25:43,377 --> 01:25:44,696
We go to war

1427
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:47,353
- Against the Barbies?
- No, against the Kens

1428
01:25:47,473 --> 01:25:48,944
- But we are the Kens
- The other Kens

1429
01:25:49,064 --> 01:25:50,330
Well we should probably
call them something

1430
01:25:50,354 --> 01:25:51,398
else so that it
doesn't get confusing

1431
01:25:51,418 --> 01:25:52,793
No, because we'll
know what we mean

1432
01:25:52,817 --> 01:25:54,882
But when we're on the battlefield
and you "Ken at 4 o'clock"...

1433
01:25:54,902 --> 01:25:59,063
- ...how will I if you mean us Kens or the other Kens?
- Because my dudes, we attack at 10 o'clock

1434
01:25:59,395 --> 01:26:01,436
We take advantage
of the morning waves

1435
01:26:01,556 --> 01:26:04,277
But not so early, because
we're going to want to sleep in

1436
01:26:05,025 --> 01:26:06,918
But what will we fight
with? We have no guns

1437
01:26:07,038 --> 01:26:09,125
Tennis rackets and volleyballs

1438
01:26:09,245 --> 01:26:11,728
- And slap fights
- And beach offs

1439
01:26:11,952 --> 01:26:13,952

And now they destroy themselves

1457
01:28:21,364 --> 01:28:24,342
You know what I think, I think we
should put our fricken Constitution back

1458
01:28:24,868 --> 01:28:26,268
- Yes!
- Yes!

1459
01:28:32,631 --> 01:28:34,620

01:28:38,831 --> 01:28:40,631

- What?

1491
01:31:22,051 --> 01:31:25,123
- To change the Constitution
- That was today, wasn't it?

1492
01:31:30,957 --> 01:31:32,972
Okay ladies, let's do this!

1493
01:31:33,092 --> 01:31:36,372
All those in favor of letting
Barbie Land, be Barbie Land...

1494
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:37,840
...say "I"

1495
01:31:37,864 --> 01:31:39,864
I!

1496
01:31:53,294 --> 01:31:54,894
I'm so happy

1497
01:31:55,475 --> 01:31:57,386
Go, Barbie! Go, Barbie!

1498
01:31:57,410 --> 01:31:59,321
Go, Barbie! Go, Barbie!

1499
01:32:14,016 --> 01:32:15,520
Is it just my imagination...

1500
01:32:15,544 --> 01:32:17,982
Or do these Mojo Dojo Casa Houses...

1501
01:32:17,983 --> 01:32:19,583
...just get dreamier?

1502
01:32:20,710 --> 01:32:23,207
That's because they're dreamhouses, mother------

1503
01:32:23,667 --> 01:32:27,874
That's right, we've reinstated the Barbie
Land Constitution to what it should be

1504
01:32:27,994 --> 01:32:31,296
And restored all the
Barbies' brains and autonomy

1505
01:32:35,257 --> 01:32:37,628
And we seriously
disinfected those houses

1506
01:32:37,748 --> 01:32:38,798
What do we do?

1507
01:32:40,886 --> 01:32:42,081
Kens?!

1508
01:32:44,055 --> 01:32:45,355
Who are we attacking, sir?

1509
01:32:45,379 --> 01:32:47,979
No

1510
01:32:48,403 --> 01:32:49,503
No!

1511
01:32:53,085 --> 01:32:54,430
Don't look at me!

1512
01:32:55,994 --> 01:32:56,844
Is he crying?

1513
01:32:57,493 --> 01:32:59,193
Just... give us a minute.

1514
01:33:04,834 --> 01:33:05,634
Ken?

1515
01:33:08,732 --> 01:33:11,457
- Are you ok?
- Yeah. Totally

1516
01:33:11,739 --> 01:33:13,499
It's okay if you're
crying. You know, I

1517
01:33:13,523 --> 01:33:15,655
cried too and it's
actually kind of amazing

1518
01:33:15,775 --> 01:33:18,216
I'm a liberated man, I
don't cry, he's not weak

1519
01:33:18,336 --> 01:33:19,336
Okay...

1520
01:33:21,919 --> 01:33:23,469
Do you want to
sit up for a minute?

1521
01:33:30,609 --> 01:33:32,209
It was hard running stuff

1522
01:33:33,370 --> 01:33:34,570
I didn't love it

1523
01:33:36,337 --> 01:33:37,437
I get it

1524
01:33:41,749 --> 01:33:44,205
And those mini
fridges are so small

1525
01:33:44,788 --> 01:33:46,256
You can only fit
a six pack in there

1526
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:49,048
and the freezers
are basically useless

1527
01:33:51,215 --> 01:33:54,299
To be honest, when I found out
the patriarchy wasn't about horses

1528
01:33:54,419 --> 01:33:56,055
I had lost interest anyway

1529
01:33:57,286 --> 01:33:58,436
That's okay

1530
01:34:03,773 --> 01:34:06,418
I always thought this
would be our house

1531
01:34:09,242 --> 01:34:10,242
Oh...

1532
01:34:13,530 --> 01:34:14,330
Ken...

1533
01:34:16,810 --> 01:34:18,785
I think I owe you an apology

1534
01:34:19,563 --> 01:34:21,763
I'm really sorry I
took you for granted

1535
01:34:24,197 --> 01:34:26,997
Not every night
had to be Girl's Night

1536
01:34:30,298 --> 01:34:32,098
Thank you for saying that

1537
01:34:33,299 --> 01:34:34,299
Thank you

1538
01:34:36,466 --> 01:34:39,115
Oh, I didn't mean suggest...uhh

1539
01:34:39,571 --> 01:34:41,721
I just don't know
who I am without you

1540
01:34:43,652 --> 01:34:44,923
You're Ken

1541
01:34:46,288 --> 01:34:48,800
But it's "Barbie... and Ken"

1542
01:34:50,873 --> 01:34:53,141
There is no just Ken

1543
01:34:54,530 --> 01:34:56,080
That's why I was created

1544
01:34:56,788 --> 01:34:58,186
I only exist...

1545
01:34:59,970 --> 01:35:02,004
within the warmth of your gaze

1546
01:35:03,274 --> 01:35:04,424
Without it...

1547
01:35:05,616 --> 01:35:09,391
i'm just an another blonde
guy who can't do flips

1548
01:35:18,376 --> 01:35:23,009
Maybe it's time to
discover who Ken is.

1549
01:35:23,734 --> 01:35:25,484
Ok, I think I get it now

1550
01:35:26,115 --> 01:35:28,578
No no no no no, this isn't the answer

1551
01:35:32,015 --> 01:35:33,415
I feel so stupid

1552
01:35:34,469 --> 01:35:36,121
I look so stupid

1553
01:35:36,977 --> 01:35:39,616
I look so stupid!

1554
01:35:39,736 --> 01:35:41,850
- No!
- You look cool! You look so cool!

1555
01:35:43,151 --> 01:35:47,296
Okay Ken, you have to figure
out who you are without me

1556
01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:51,627
- Why?
- You're not your girlfriend

1557
01:35:52,018 --> 01:35:54,580
You're not your house,
you're not your mink

1558
01:35:55,181 --> 01:35:58,124
- Beach;
- Nope, you're not even beach

1559
01:35:59,156 --> 01:36:01,248
Maybe all the things
that you thought

1560
01:36:01,727 --> 01:36:03,838
made you <i>you</i> aren't...

1561
01:36:05,124 --> 01:36:07,060
...really <i>you</i>.

1562
01:36:11,764 --> 01:36:14,384
Maybe it's Barbie and...

1563
01:36:16,374 --> 01:36:17,974
It's Ken

1564
01:36:21,214 --> 01:36:22,114
Ken...

1565
01:36:23,374 --> 01:36:24,274
is...

1566
01:36:26,264 --> 01:36:27,710
- ...me?
- Yes!

1567
01:36:28,072 --> 01:36:30,506
Ken is me

1568
01:36:32,291 --> 01:36:33,641
And I'm Barbie

1569
01:36:36,774 --> 01:36:37,574
Ken...

1570
01:36:39,609 --> 01:36:40,899
...is me!

1571
01:36:41,019 --> 01:36:42,345
- Ken is me!
- Ken is me!

1572
01:36:42,369 --> 01:36:43,094
Ken is me!

1573
01:36:43,818 --> 01:36:46,552
I don't even care about being Ken
anymore, I just miss my friend Barbie

1574
01:36:46,672 --> 01:36:48,222
- That's cool
- Barbie. Barbie!

1575
01:36:48,476 --> 01:36:49,476
I'm right here

1576
01:36:50,119 --> 01:36:50,919
Ken!

1577
01:36:55,638 --> 01:36:57,457
I want you to have it

1578
01:36:59,334 --> 01:37:00,384
It's nice

1579
01:37:07,838 --> 01:37:10,688
We were only fighting because
we didn't know who we were

1580
01:37:12,764 --> 01:37:14,643
Ken is...

1581
01:37:15,407 --> 01:37:17,408
ME!

1582
01:37:26,343 --> 01:37:27,693
Ken is right

1583
01:37:27,942 --> 01:37:30,416
It's just so hard to be a leader

1584
01:37:30,650 --> 01:37:32,664
- You know...
- That's... my boss

1585
01:37:34,566 --> 01:37:35,466
Midge.

1586
01:37:36,756 --> 01:37:38,456
I thought we discontinued her

1587
01:37:40,452 --> 01:37:42,599
Look, you know how many times

1588
01:37:43,296 --> 01:37:45,417
I've wanted to stand
up in a boardmeeting

1589
01:37:45,537 --> 01:37:47,945
and just say "can we
just tickle each other?"

1590
01:37:48,448 --> 01:37:51,408
- Really?
- Let's have a company retreat and just tickle each other!

1591
01:37:51,528 --> 01:37:53,091
Someone get me. Someone get me

1592
01:37:55,665 --> 01:37:57,367
I love being tickled

1593
01:37:57,749 --> 01:38:00,239
No no no no no no.  Don't hug me

1594
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:04,670
But thanks to Barbies,

1595
01:38:04,972 --> 01:38:09,107
I too can now relieve myself of
this heavy existential burden while

1596
01:38:09,227 --> 01:38:12,177
holding onto the
very real title of CEO

1597
01:38:12,899 --> 01:38:17,021
And we can restore everything in
Barbie Land to exactly the way it was

1598
01:38:17,141 --> 01:38:18,991
- Mr. Mattel...
- Please

1599
01:38:19,512 --> 01:38:21,582
- Call me mother
- No thank you

1600
01:38:22,067 --> 01:38:25,189
I don't think that things should go
back to the way that they were

1601
01:38:25,309 --> 01:38:29,156
No Barbie or Ken should
be living in the shadows

1602
01:38:29,550 --> 01:38:30,650
Or Alan

1603
01:38:31,644 --> 01:38:33,126
- Hey
- Yeah

1604
01:38:34,008 --> 01:38:36,033
- Hello
- I just want to say I'm sorry...

1605
01:38:36,153 --> 01:38:39,033
we called you Weird Barbie behind
your back and also to your face

1606
01:38:39,153 --> 01:38:41,203
It's okay. I'm owning it

1607
01:38:41,323 --> 01:38:43,115
Would you like a job in my Cabinet?

1608
01:38:43,416 --> 01:38:45,266
May I please have Sanitation?

1609
01:38:46,437 --> 01:38:48,730
- It's yours!
- Yeah, uh, thank you

1610
01:38:48,850 --> 01:38:50,550
- Alright
- Madame President

1611
01:38:51,411 --> 01:38:53,795
Please may the Kens have
one Supreme Court justice?

1612
01:38:53,915 --> 01:38:55,428
Oh, I can't do that

1613
01:38:55,863 --> 01:38:58,402
But maybe a lower circuit court judgeship...

1614
01:38:58,422 --> 01:39:00,330
We accept! As long as we can wear robes

1615
01:39:00,450 --> 01:39:02,507
<i>Well the Kens have to start somewhere</i>

1616
01:39:02,627 --> 01:39:07,009
<i>And one day the Kens will have as
much power and influence in Barbie Land</i>

1617
01:39:07,129 --> 01:39:09,557
<i>As women have in the Real World</i>

1618
01:39:09,677 --> 01:39:10,797
I don't want to...

1619
01:39:10,917 --> 01:39:12,227
- Just go!
- I can't!

1620
01:39:12,347 --> 01:39:14,435
- Grow up and go
- I have an idea

1621
01:39:15,433 --> 01:39:17,110
Tell me your secret dream, child

1622
01:39:17,230 --> 01:39:19,530
Okay, what about Ordinary Barbie?

1623
01:39:20,475 --> 01:39:22,214
She's not
extraordinary. She's...

1624
01:39:22,238 --> 01:39:24,349
not president of anything.
Or maybe she is

1625
01:39:24,469 --> 01:39:26,787
Maybe she's a
mom, maybe she's not

1626
01:39:26,907 --> 01:39:29,945
Because it's okay, to
just want to be a mom

1627
01:39:30,065 --> 01:39:32,415
or to want to President,
or a mom who is President

1628
01:39:32,439 --> 01:39:34,345
or not a mom who
is also not President

1629
01:39:34,469 --> 01:39:36,353
She just has a flattering top

1630
01:39:36,473 --> 01:39:40,373
And she wants to get through the
day feeling kind of good about herself

1631
01:39:42,813 --> 01:39:43,663
That's a...

1632
01:39:44,007 --> 01:39:46,218
- ...terrible idea
- Yeah, that's going to make money

1633
01:39:46,408 --> 01:39:48,550
Oh, Ordinary Barbie, I love it!

1634
01:39:49,170 --> 01:39:50,220
Fantastic.

1635
01:39:51,049 --> 01:39:52,281
- Great
- Great

1636
01:39:52,401 --> 01:39:53,652
- Cool
- Yeah

1637
01:39:54,052 --> 01:39:55,402
I think we're good, right?

1638
01:39:55,939 --> 01:39:59,389
Alright, let's begin the work to close
the portal between our two worlds

1639
01:40:01,282 --> 01:40:03,353
- And about Barbie?
-What do you mean?

1640
01:40:05,171 --> 01:40:06,357
What's her ending?

1641
01:40:06,794 --> 01:40:08,044
What does she get?

1642
01:40:09,965 --> 01:40:10,915
Well that's easy

1643
01:40:10,976 --> 01:40:12,426
She in love with Ken

1644
01:40:13,067 --> 01:40:14,590
That is not her ending

1645
01:40:16,633 --> 01:40:18,261
I'm not in love with Ken

1646
01:40:18,955 --> 01:40:19,955
What do you want?

1647
01:40:21,874 --> 01:40:23,150
I don't know... I'm...

1648
01:40:25,453 --> 01:40:28,143
I'm not really sure
where I belong anymore

1649
01:40:33,052 --> 01:40:34,878
I don't think I have an ending

1650
01:40:34,998 --> 01:40:36,748
That was always the point

1651
01:40:37,235 --> 01:40:40,236
I created you so you
wouldn't have an ending

1652
01:40:41,854 --> 01:40:42,837
It's you

1653
01:40:45,438 --> 01:40:46,917
You're Ruth from Mattel

1654
01:40:47,717 --> 01:40:49,700
Baby, I <i>am</i> Mattel

1655
01:40:50,222 --> 01:40:52,954
Until the IRS got to me,
but that's another movie

1656
01:40:53,074 --> 01:40:55,018
- So you're...
- Ruth Handler

1657
01:40:55,439 --> 01:40:57,189
Inventory of Barbie

1658
01:40:58,654 --> 01:40:59,688
That's so cool

1659
01:40:59,848 --> 01:41:02,179
Her ghost keeps an
office on the 17th floor

1660
01:41:02,299 --> 01:41:03,237
- What?
- What?

1661
01:41:03,357 --> 01:41:08,114
You guys, do you think the lady
who invented Barbie looks like Barbie?

1662
01:41:08,697 --> 01:41:13,422
I'm a 5 foot nothing grandma with a
double mastectomy and tax evasion issues

1663
01:41:14,055 --> 01:41:16,205
Nobody looks like Barbie

1664
01:41:16,705 --> 01:41:19,777
Except, of course, Barbie.
Take a bow down, honey

1665
01:41:22,229 --> 01:41:24,854
I don't really feel
like Barbie anymore

1666
01:41:29,085 --> 01:41:30,585
Come. Walk with me

1667
01:41:50,940 --> 01:41:52,090
Thank you

1668
01:41:53,919 --> 01:41:55,519
Thank you, Barbie

1669
01:41:57,342 --> 01:41:58,342
Thank you

1670
01:42:08,188 --> 01:42:10,028
I'm not really sure what
I'm supposed to do now

1671
01:42:10,036 --> 01:42:13,449
I've always been
Stereotypical Barbie and...

1672
01:42:14,176 --> 01:42:16,116
and don't think I'm really
good at anything else

1673
01:42:16,371 --> 01:42:20,314
- You saved Barbie Land from patriarchy
- That was very much a group effort

1674
01:42:21,208 --> 01:42:23,472
And you helped that
mother and daughter connect

1675
01:42:24,175 --> 01:42:25,725
They really helped each other

1676
01:42:27,131 --> 01:42:29,266
Maybe you're Self-Effacing Barbie?

1677
01:42:31,478 --> 01:42:33,478
Maybe I'm not Barbie anymore

1678
01:42:42,717 --> 01:42:46,172
You understand that
humans only have one end

1679
01:42:46,562 --> 01:42:48,262
Ideas live forever

1680
01:42:48,732 --> 01:42:50,282
Humans not so much

1681
01:42:50,765 --> 01:42:52,065
You know that, right?

1682
01:42:52,302 --> 01:42:53,102
I do

1683
01:42:53,415 --> 01:42:55,970
Being human can be
pretty uncomfortable

1684
01:42:57,818 --> 01:42:58,718
I know.

1685
01:42:59,137 --> 01:43:03,002
People make up things like
the patriarchy and Barbie...

1686
01:43:03,576 --> 01:43:06,263
just to deal with how
uncomfortable it is

1687
01:43:07,075 --> 01:43:08,325
I understand that

1688
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,248
And then you die

1689
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:13,200
Yeah

1690
01:43:15,448 --> 01:43:16,248
Yeah

1691
01:43:23,298 --> 01:43:26,764
I want to be part of the people...

1692
01:43:27,420 --> 01:43:29,020
that make meaning

1693
01:43:30,714 --> 01:43:32,317
Not the thing that's made

1694
01:43:35,257 --> 01:43:38,063
I want to do the imagining.
I don't want to be the idea

1695
01:43:38,326 --> 01:43:39,476
Does that makes sense?

1696
01:43:40,417 --> 01:43:44,932
I always knew that Barbie would
surprise me, but I never expected this

1697
01:43:45,721 --> 01:43:47,238
Do you give me permission to...

1698
01:43:48,255 --> 01:43:49,605
become human?

1699
01:43:50,372 --> 01:43:53,445
- You don't need my permission
- But you're the Creator, you...

1700
01:43:54,572 --> 01:43:55,872
Don't you control me?

1701
01:43:55,992 --> 01:44:00,022
I can't control you, anymore
than I can control my own daughter

1702
01:44:00,939 --> 01:44:03,311
I named you after her: Barbara

1703
01:44:03,631 --> 01:44:06,731
And I always hoped for
you, like I hoped for her

1704
01:44:08,328 --> 01:44:11,048
We mothers stand
still so our daughters

1705
01:44:11,168 --> 01:44:14,279
can look back and see
how far they've come

1706
01:44:19,352 --> 01:44:21,859
So being human's not
something I need to...

1707
01:44:22,836 --> 01:44:24,036
ask for? Or...

1708
01:44:25,298 --> 01:44:26,948
even want?  I can just...

1709
01:44:28,830 --> 01:44:30,976
It's something I just discover I am?

1710
01:44:33,340 --> 01:44:35,331
I can't in good
conscience let you take

1711
01:44:35,355 --> 01:44:37,779
this leap without you
knowing what it means

1712
01:44:41,856 --> 01:44:43,105
Take my hands

1713
01:44:50,083 --> 01:44:51,567
Now, close your eyes...

1714
01:45:02,102 --> 01:45:03,448
Now, feel

1715
01:46:35,282 --> 01:46:39,833
<i>So Barbie left behind the pastels
and plastics of Barbie Land...</i>

1716
01:46:39,953 --> 01:46:42,600
<i>for the pastels and
plastics of Los Angeles</i>

1717
01:46:42,998 --> 01:46:45,144
Okay. Thanks for the lift

1718
01:46:46,033 --> 01:46:48,310
- You've got this
- I'm really proud of you

1719
01:46:48,634 --> 01:46:52,234
Estoy muy orguoso de ti

1720
01:46:52,258 --> 01:46:53,858
Orgu-LLO-so

1721
01:46:53,882 --> 01:46:55,882
Orgulloso

1722
01:46:55,906 --> 01:46:57,316
Orgulloso de ti

1723
01:46:57,340 --> 01:46:58,906
There you go. Close enough

1724
01:46:59,279 --> 01:47:01,383
You guys are the
